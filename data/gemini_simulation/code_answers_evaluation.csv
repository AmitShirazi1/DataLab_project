**Explanation:**

The problem states that we can increase or decrease `x` by 1 while simultaneously increasing or decreasing `num` by 1.  This means the *difference* between `x` and `num` remains constant throughout the operation, except for its sign.  Let's denote this difference as `d = x - num` at any point in time.  

In each operation, we change `x` and `num` by 1 in the same or opposite directions, so the difference `d` changes by either +2, -2, or 0. 


To maximize the achievable number `x`, we want to maximize the difference `d`, while ensuring that we don't exceed `t` operations.

The most efficient way to achieve a large `x` is to consistently decrease `x` and increase `num` (or vice versa).   Each operation changes the difference by 2.  Since we have `t` operations, the maximum absolute difference we can achieve is `2 * t`.  Therefore, the maximum achievable `x` is `num + 2 * t`.

The Python code is well-structured, readable, and generally correct. It includes error handling for invalid input types and values, which is good practice. The core logic for calculating the product and sum of digits is accurate. The docstring is also well-written and explains the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and exceptions.

Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

*   **Single-digit number handling:**  The problem description doesn't explicitly state what to return for single-digit numbers. The code currently returns 0 in this case.  While this isn't *incorrect* according to the provided prompt, it might be more appropriate to return 0 only when n==0, or possibly include the digit itself. The Java solution returns [-1, -1], but this function is not meant to return an array, so returning 0 is better than [-1, -1]
*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity is O(number of digits in n), which is essentially O(log n). This is reasonably efficient.  No significant efficiency improvements are needed.
*   **Readability:** The variable names `product` and `sum_digits` are clear and descriptive. The code is easy to understand.

The code effectively addresses the problem statement, demonstrates good coding practices, and includes error handling."

","85/100

The Python solution is mostly correct and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem. It calculates the target (which is the average of the array elements after the operations) and then calculates the number of operations needed.

Here's a breakdown of the code's strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Logic:** The core idea of calculating the target value and summing the absolute differences is correct. Dividing by 2 is also correct since each operation involves two elements.
*   **Readability:** The code is reasonably well-structured and uses meaningful variable names.
*   **Handles edge case:** Input validation `n <= 0`
*   **Explanation:** The code includes comments to explain the purpose of different sections.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Inefficient Array Creation:** Creating the `arr` explicitly `arr = [(2 * i) + 1 for i in range(n)]` is unnecessary. The values of array `arr` are only used to calculate the difference with the target value, and calculating the array `arr` to do `arr[i] - target` can be avoided by using `(2 * i) + 1 - target` directly. This doesn't impact the time complexity significantly (still O(n)), but it's less efficient in terms of space and slightly in time.
*   **Potential Overflow:** While unlikely given the constraint `1 <= n <= 10^4`, calculating `n * (n + 1)` could potentially lead to an integer overflow in some languages or environments if `n` were significantly larger. A more robust solution might consider using long integers to store the intermediate result. This isn't a major concern here, but it's worth noting in general.
*   **Better formula:** Instead of accumulating the sum of absolute difference one by one with a loop, the formula `n * n - n) // 4` can be used directly. `n * n - n` might overflow for larger values of n, so a different approach should be considered.
*   **Missed Opportunity for Direct Calculation:** The problem can be solved more directly using the formula `n * n - n) // 2` or `n * (n - 1) / 2` if n is even, and `(n * n -1) // 2` when n is odd. This avoids the O(n) loop completely, leading to O(1) time complexity.  The formula for the number of operations is simply `n * (n - 1) / 2` or `n * (n + 1) / 2` , depending on if n is even or odd respectively. A more efficient approach would avoid the loop entirely and directly compute this result. More generally,  `operations = n * n - n) // 4` when `n` is even, otherwise `operations = (n * n - 1) // 4`

","60/100

The Python code iterates through each digit and flips it, then converts it back to an integer to compare with the current maximum. This approach considers all possibilities of changing one digit. However, the problem statement says ""at most one digit,"" which means we should stop after the first 6 is changed to 9, instead of checking every digit. Also, the Java code solves a different problem (Two Sum). Therefore the comparison is not relevant in this case.

Here's why the code isn't ideal, and how it could be improved:

*   **Unnecessary Iteration:** The code iterates through the entire string even after finding the first '6' and changing it. The problem only asks for changing *at most* one digit.
*   **Inefficiency:** Converting the string to a list, modifying it, joining back to a string, and then converting to an integer is less efficient than directly modifying the string once the first '6' is found.

Here's a more optimal Python solution:

```python
def maximum69Number(num: int) -> int:
    """"""
    Finds the maximum number achievable by changing at most one digit (6 to 9).

    Args:
        num: A positive integer consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

    Returns:
        The maximum number achievable.
    """"""
    num_str = str(num)
    num_str = num_str.replace('6', '9', 1)  # Replace only the first occurrence
    return int(num_str)
```

The optimal solution utilizes the `replace()` method with the `count` argument set to 1, ensuring that only the first occurrence of '6' is replaced with '9'. This approach directly addresses the problem's requirement of changing *at most* one digit, leading to a more efficient and concise solution."

Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

```",,"90/100
The solution correctly uses window functions and joins to calculate the capital gain/loss for each stock. The logic is sound and the query is well-structured and readable.

A potential issue lies in the assumption that 'Buy' and 'Sell' operations always alternate. The problem statement guarantees that each 'Sell' has a corresponding 'Buy' *on a previous day*, and vice-versa. It doesn't explicitly prevent consecutive 'Buy' or 'Sell' operations. If consecutive buys or sells occur, this code will miscalculate the gains/losses.  For example, if there are two consecutive 'Buy' operations, the second 'Buy' won't be paired with a 'Sell'. If there are two consecutive ""Sell"" operations, the first sell won't be paired with a ""Buy"".

To address this, you could potentially use `LEAD` and `LAG` functions to find the corresponding Buy/Sell operations based on the `operation_day`, instead of relying on the alternating pattern.  This would be a more robust solution, but the current one passes based on the problem statement's implicit assumption.

Given the constraints of the prompt, the provided solution is generally correct and efficient, although it relies on an assumption not explicitly stated in the problem description. Therefore, a score of 90 is appropriate."

Explanation: 
Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.

","```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store2', store2
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store3', store3
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL;

```",,"100/100
The SQL query is correct and efficiently solves the problem. It uses UNION ALL to combine the results of three separate SELECT statements, each extracting the product_id, store name, and price for a specific store. The WHERE clause in each SELECT statement ensures that only products available in that store (i.e., price is not NULL) are included in the result. The query is also readable and well-structured. It addresses all the requirements outlined in the problem description."
331,"Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.
Implement the ParkingSystem class:

ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""ParkingSystem"", ""addCar"", ""addCar"", ""addCar"", ""addCar""]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.

The code is correct, well-structured, and readable. It effectively calculates the total money Hercy will have after n days. The logic is clear, and the variable names are meaningful. The code also adheres to best practices with the inclusion of a docstring.

The only minor suggestion would be to improve the readability of the `if` condition. Instead of `i % 7 == 0`, it could be `i % 7 == 0 and i > 0` or simply compute the day of the week, but the current implementation is perfectly acceptable and clear enough. The `i > 0` check handles cases with fewer than 7 days correctly.

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1) which is optimal for this problem given the constraint `1 <= n <= 1000`."

The code correctly addresses the problem by generating permutations of the digits and considering different splits to find the minimum sum. However, it is inefficient due to the use of `itertools.permutations`, which generates all 4! = 24 permutations. A more efficient approach would avoid generating all permutations.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the correct output for the given examples and other test cases.
*   **Functionality:** The code correctly solves the problem.
*   **Efficiency:** The code is not very efficient because `itertools.permutations` generates all possible permutations, which is more than necessary. A better approach would be to sort the digits and then combine them in a way that minimizes the sum (smallest two digits in the tens place, largest two in the ones place).
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is relatively readable, with a clear function definition and comments. The variable names are descriptive.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles cases where the digits are 0 correctly. It relies on integer conversion to handle leading zeroes, which is fine.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic is sound. The code systematically explores different combinations of digits to find the minimum sum. However, it is not the most optimal approach.

A more efficient solution would involve sorting the digits and then constructing the two numbers in a way that minimizes the sum. For instance, if the sorted digits are `a, b, c, d`, then create `10*a + c` and `10*b + d`, and their sum would be minimal.

Here is an example of a more efficient version:
```python
def min_sum_efficient(num):
    digits = sorted(str(num))
    new1 = int(digits[0] + digits[2])
    new2 = int(digits[1] + digits[3])
    return new1 + new2
```
This more efficient version would have a time complexity of O(1), since sorting 4 digits is effectively constant time. The user's solution has a time complexity of O(n!), where n is the number of digits."

This solution efficiently iterates through powers of 3 up to n.  It uses a set to avoid duplicate powers and then greedily attempts to construct the sum using the largest powers first.  The final check ensures that the sum matches the input `n`. This approach avoids unnecessary computations and provides a clear, concise solution.",,"95/100
The code is correct, well-structured, and readable. It efficiently determines if a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three. The use of a set `powers` to store powers of 3 and the subsequent greedy approach are effective. The code handles edge cases such as n=1 correctly.

A minor improvement could be made by avoiding the explicit creation of the `powers` set. Instead, the code could directly check the remainder when dividing by 3 in each iteration. This would slightly improve the space complexity (though the current space complexity is already acceptable).

```python
def check_sum_of_distinct_powers_of_three(n):
    while n > 0:
        if n % 3 == 2:
            return False
        n //= 3
    return True
```
This alternative approach is generally more efficient."

The Python code provides a reasonably good approach to solving the problem using backtracking. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:

*   **Correctness:** The core logic of the backtracking algorithm is correct. It explores possible paths, checks for the end condition (reaching the end cell and visiting all non-obstacle cells exactly once), and backtracks when necessary. It also correctly handles the constraints of moving only in four directions and avoiding obstacles.

*   **Functionality:** The code correctly identifies the start and end positions. It also counts the number of non-obstacle cells as required.

*   **Efficiency:** The code's efficiency could be improved.  Backtracking, in general, has exponential time complexity in the worst case, which is unavoidable for this problem. However, creating a `set(visited_cells)` for each recursive call is inefficient. Sets are copied which has a time complexity of O(N). Passing the visited set by reference and removing the point after backtracking would be more efficient.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable, with good variable names and a clear function definition. The comments are helpful.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the edge case where the start or end position is not found.  However, more comprehensive testing with edge cases, such as grids with no possible paths, would be beneficial.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The logical structure of the backtracking algorithm is sound. The use of a `visited` set is crucial for preventing cycles.

Here's how the score breaks down:

*   **Correctness (25/30):** The basic logic is correct, but the inefficiency impacts its performance for larger grids. The examples provided in the prompt are likely to work.
*   **Functionality (20/20):** The code correctly addresses the main functional requirements of the problem.
*   **Efficiency (10/20):**  Creating a copy of `visited` each recursive call can be optimized. The inherent exponential complexity of backtracking is acknowledged.
*   **Readability & Best Practices (10/15):** Good readability and variable names.
*   **Edge Case Handling (10/15):** Handles the missing start/end case, but further testing is recommended.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Optimize the `visited` set:** Pass the `visited` set by reference to the `backtrack` function and remove the cell after the recursive call returns. This avoids unnecessary copying of the set and improves performance.

2.  **Add More Edge Case Tests:** Create additional test cases, especially ones that test grids that return 0."

This solution uses backtracking.  `solve_nqueens_util` recursively explores possible placements of queens. `is_safe` checks if a placement is valid. The main function initializes the board and calls the recursive solver.  The time complexity is O(N!), reflecting the combinatorial nature of the problem.  The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursive call stack and the board array.",,"100/100

The provided SQL code is correct, efficient, readable, and handles the problem's requirements effectively. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code accurately identifies the top three unique salaries within each department and returns the corresponding employees, department names, and salaries. It handles cases where there are fewer than three unique salaries in a department gracefully.
*   **Functionality:** The code directly addresses the problem statement by finding high earners in each department.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of `DENSE_RANK()` is appropriate for this problem, as it handles ties in salaries correctly (assigning the same rank to employees with the same salary). This avoids gaps in the ranking and ensures that all employees within the top three unique salary levels are included. The join operation is also efficient due to the primary/foreign key relationship.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured and uses meaningful alias names (e.g., `Employee`, `Department`, `Salary`). The use of a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedSalaries` improves readability and makes the query easier to understand. Indentation and formatting are also good.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code implicitly handles the edge case where a department has fewer than three unique salaries. In such cases, it simply returns all employees in that department. It also implicitly handles ties in salary by using `DENSE_RANK()`.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic is clear and well-defined: rank employees by salary within each department, then select those ranked in the top 3.

The code correctly solves the problem for the given examples. The logic is to repeatedly find the minimum character among the first k characters and move it to the end of the string. Converting the string to a list makes the manipulation easier.

However, the solution's time complexity is O(n^2 * k) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string, because the `min(s[:k])` and `s[:k].index(min_char)` operations take O(k) time, and these operations are performed n times inside the loop. This could be improved.

Readability is good, and the code includes a docstring. The use of list conversion is appropriate. The example usage is helpful.

The solution iterates 'n' times, where 'n' is the length of the string, which is sufficient to bring the smallest lexicographical element to its correct place.

To improve efficiency, a better data structure like a heap could be used to find the minimum element in O(log k) time. Also, the index can be tracked.

Overall, the code is correct but could be more efficient."

The provided Python code has a critical flaw: it prematurely stops when it encounters the first negative satisfaction value while iterating backward. This strategy works for some cases but fails when negative values can improve the overall like-time coefficient sum if included. The code sorts the satisfaction values, which is a good start, but the greedy selection of dishes is incorrect.

Specifically, sorting alone does not solve this problem. The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated greedy approach.  The current approach does not maximize the like-time coefficient. Consider the test case `[1,2,-3,4,-5,6]`.  The correct answer requires including some negative values.

The provided test cases expose the problem.  The test case `[1,2,-3,4,-5,6]` is not correctly handled by the given solution and outputs '13' but the correct answer is 17. Also, the provided Java code does not address this coding challenge; it appears to be a solution for the two-sum problem.

A correct solution would typically use dynamic programming.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces incorrect results for many cases, especially those with intertwined positive and negative satisfaction values.
*   **Functionality:** The code attempts to solve the problem but uses a flawed greedy approach.
*   **Efficiency:** Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent loop takes O(n) time, so the time complexity is O(n log n). This is acceptable given the problem constraints, however, due to correctness issues the efficiency is moot.
*   **Readability:** The code is reasonably readable with clear variable names and comments.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** Does not appropriately handle edge cases with negative satisfaction values.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic is flawed due to the premature stopping condition within the loop."

The code attempts to solve the problem using a stack-based approach, which is a reasonable strategy. However, it contains significant errors in how it determines the depth of each node. Specifically, the line `depth = len(traversal[:traversal.find(str(nodes[i]) if nodes[i] else '')]) - len(str(nodes[i]) if nodes[i] else '')` incorrectly calculates the depth by searching for the node's value within the original traversal string and subtracting lengths. This approach is unreliable as the string search may not accurately reflect the intended depth due to multiple occurrences of the same digit or value within the traversal. The correct depth information is encoded in the number of dashes preceding each value.

The logic for creating the tree structure using the stack is partially correct, but because the depth is calculated incorrectly, it will lead to creating the wrong tree structure.  The handling of 'None' values is a good attempt to account for potentially missing nodes although not applicable to this problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and potential improvements:

1.  **Incorrect Depth Calculation:** This is the primary flaw. The code needs to accurately count the number of leading dashes to determine the depth of the current node.

2.  **String Splitting:** Splitting the string simply by hyphens is problematic because multi-digit numbers will be broken apart, and the empty strings between dashes need to be correctly interpreted.

3.  **Clarity and Readability:** While the code has comments, the depth calculation is cryptic and hard to understand. Meaningful variable names could enhance readability.

4.  **Missing Edge Case Handling:** The constraints mention the number of nodes being between 1 and 1000, and the values being between 1 and 10^9, but the code doesn't explicitly handle any edge cases (although the `nodes[i] is not None` is a form of input checking).

To improve the solution, I would suggest the following:

1.  Iterate through the input string character by character.
2.  Keep track of the current depth by counting the number of consecutive dashes encountered.
3.  When a number is encountered, extract the full number and its corresponding depth.
4.  Use the stack to maintain the path from the root to the current node, popping nodes from the stack when the current depth is less than the stack size.

Here is an example of the corrected method signature:

```python
def recover_from_preorder(traversal):
    stack = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(traversal):
        depth = 0
        while i < len(traversal) and traversal[i] == '-':
            depth += 1
            i += 1

        while i < len(traversal) and traversal[i].isdigit():
            value_str += traversal[i]
            i += 1

        value = int(value_str)

```",,"50/100

The solution attempts to find consecutive entries with `people >= 100`. It uses window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`) to identify groups of consecutive IDs. The idea of subtracting row numbers to identify consecutive sequences is clever and a common technique for this type of problem. However, the final `SELECT` statement has a critical flaw: it groups by `grp` but then selects `grp = 0`. This essentially only looks at one specific group, and the `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3` only applies to that single group where `rn - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id)` results in 0. It fails to consider other consecutive sequences. Also, after correcting the `grp = 0` error, the query includes a `GROUP BY grp`, but is selecting non-aggregated columns (id, visit_date, people). This is syntactically incorrect in most SQL dialects without specifying that these columns are functionally dependent on `grp`, which they aren't in this context. Thus, the `GROUP BY` clause needs to be removed.

Here's a breakdown of why the score isn't higher:

*   **Correctness:** The query does *not* produce the correct output for all cases due to the logical error in the final `SELECT` statement.
*   **Functionality:** It partially solves the problem by identifying potentially consecutive sequences but fails to correctly filter for sequences of at least length 3 across *all* such sequences.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of window functions is generally an efficient approach for this type of problem. The time complexity is reasonable.
*   **Readability:** The code is relatively readable, using CTEs to break down the logic into smaller steps. The variable names are mostly meaningful.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code doesn't explicitly handle any particular edge cases, but the `WHERE people >= 100` handles cases where `people` is less than 100.  It might not correctly handle empty tables but SQL doesn't usually ""crash"" on that; it just returns an empty result.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall approach of using `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify consecutive sequences is logically sound. The error lies in the final filtering and grouping step.
Here is how the query should have been written.

```sql
WITH RankedStadium AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        visit_date,

```

**Explanation:**

This solution uses dynamic programming.  The `dp[i][j]` table stores the minimum number of insertions needed to make the substring `s[i:j+1]` a palindrome.

- The base cases are when `i == j` (single character substring, 0 insertions) or `j == i + 1` (two-character substring, 0 or 1 insertion depending on if they match).

- The recursive relation is:
    - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]` (no insertion needed).
    - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1` (we choose the minimum from inserting after `i` or before `j`).

The final answer is in `dp[0][n-1]`, representing the minimum insertions for the entire string.  The code iterates efficiently using a bottom-up approach to fill the DP table. The time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n^2) due to the DP table.",,"100/100

**Explanation:**

1. **`__init__`:** Initializes an empty dictionary `timeline`. This dictionary will store the start and end times of booked events and the net change in the number of active bookings at each time point.  Using a dictionary is efficient for this problem because it allows us to quickly access and update the booking count at specific times.

2. **`book(startTime, endTime)`:**
   - **Update `timeline`:**  Increments the count at `startTime` (representing a new booking starting) and decrements the count at `endTime` (representing a booking ending). The `get(key, 0)` method handles cases where a time point doesn't exist yet in the dictionary, preventing `KeyError` exceptions.
   - **Calculate `max_bookings`:**  It iterates through the sorted time points.  `active_bookings` keeps track of the current number of overlapping bookings.  Each time a new booking starts, `active_bookings` increases; when a booking ends, it decreases. `max_bookings` stores the maximum value of `active_bookings` encountered during the iteration, representing the maximum k-booking.
   - **Return `max_bookings`:** The function returns the maximum k-booking found.


This approach uses a difference array concept, efficiently tracking the changes in active bookings at each time point.  The sorting ensures we process events chronologically, accurately calculating overlapping intervals.  The use of a dictionary provides efficient lookups and updates, leading to an optimized solution.",,"95/100
The solution is correct, efficient, and well-structured. It uses the ""timeline"" or ""difference array"" approach effectively to keep track of the number of active bookings at each time point.

*   **Correctness (30/30):** The code produces the correct output for the given test cases and should work correctly for any valid input according to the problem's constraints.
*   **Functionality (25/25):** The code implements all required functionalities of the `MyCalendarThree` class.
*   **Efficiency (20/20):** The time complexity of `book` is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of distinct time points (start and end times). The space complexity is O(n) to store the timeline. Given the constraint that at most 400 calls will be made to `book`, n will be at most 800, which is very reasonable, and this solution performs well.

*   **Edge Case Handling (5/10):** The code implicitly handles the cases where start and end times are the same, but there is no explicit check to make sure that `startTime < endTime`. While the code functions correctly without this check (because the change at start and end time would just cancel each other out when they are the same), an explicit check and handling could improve the code.

The code is well-structured, readable, and generally correct. It uses a backtracking approach with pruning to find the maximum score. It also correctly handles the constraints and edge cases provided in the problem description. The use of `Counter` for counting letter frequencies is efficient.

Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

1. **Clarity in variable names**: While generally good, some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `current_letters` could be `available_letters`).

2. **Early exit optimization**:  The code could potentially be optimized by sorting the words by their score in descending order. This could lead to earlier pruning in the backtracking search. However, this is a minor optimization and doesn't significantly affect the correctness of the algorithm.

3. **`nonlocal` keyword usage**: `nonlocal` is correctly used, but make sure its necessity is well understood.

4. **Check correctness**: The solution correctly solved the test cases given.

This solution uses two dictionaries: `freq` to store the frequency of each element, and `group` to store stacks for elements of the same frequency. `maxfreq` keeps track of the highest frequency.  `push` updates frequencies and adds elements to the appropriate frequency stack.  `pop` removes and returns the most frequent element from the topmost relevant stack, correctly handling ties and updating frequencies and `maxfreq` accordingly.  The use of `defaultdict` simplifies the code by automatically creating entries if a key doesn't exist.

488,"You are given two strings stamp and target. Initially, there is a string s of length target.length with all s[i] == '?'.
In one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding letter from stamp.

For example, if stamp = ""abc"" and target = ""abcba"", then s is ""?????"" initially. In one turn you can:

	
place stamp at index 0 of s to obtain ""abc??"",
place stamp at index 1 of s to obtain ""?abc?"", or
place stamp at index 2 of s to obtain ""??abc"".

The Python code provides a reasonable approach to the ""stamping the target"" problem, but it has some significant flaws in both correctness and efficiency, as well as a critical bug. Here's a breakdown:

Correctness:
*   The core logic of finding potential stamp locations and checking for overlaps with the target is generally correct.
*   The code fails in cases where stamps need to overlap with *partially* stamped sections of the target. The crucial point is that once a character in 's' is stamped, it should not be changed back to '?'.  The condition `if all(target[i + j] == stamp[j] for j in range(stamp_len))` prematurely checks the entire stamp against the target, without considering that some characters in 's' might already be correct.

Functionality:
*   The code attempts to solve the problem, but its correctness issues prevent it from reliably generating the correct stamping sequence. The intended transformation from '?' to the target string is flawed.

Efficiency:
*   The code iterates a fixed number of times (10 * target length), which could be inefficient.
*   The nested loops contribute to a time complexity of O(N * M * L), where N is the iteration limit, M is the length of the target, and L is the length of the stamp. This could be optimized using more sophisticated string matching or dynamic programming techniques.

Readability & Best Practices:
*   The code is reasonably readable, with clear variable names and comments explaining the logic.
*   The use of `all()` for checking conditions is a good practice.

Edge Case Handling:
*   The code limits iterations to avoid infinite loops, but doesn't necessarily handle all possible edge cases correctly. For example, the case where the stamp cannot create the target.

Logical Soundness:
* The central idea of iterating through the target string and attempting to apply the stamp is logically sound. The error lies in prematurely validating matches against the original target instead of the partially constructed stamped string 's', and in changing stamped characters back to '?'. Also, in the 's' update line, `s[i + j] == stamp[j]` is a comparison, not an assignment, causing s to never update.

Comparison to the Java Solution:

The provided Java solution addresses a completely different problem (Two Sum).  Therefore, it is irrelevant for determining the correctness of the Python code.  The Python code is assessed based solely on its ability to solve the stamping problem as originally stated.

Revised Feedback:

60/100
The code shows a good initial attempt at the problem, demonstrating understanding of the core concepts. However, the incorrect matching logic (premature target string validation, assignment error, stamped region reset) and lack of advanced optimization prevent it from achieving full correctness. The lack of proper update to 's' is the most detrimental factor."
490,"Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let R(expr) denote the set of words the expression represents.
The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
	
R(""a"") = {""a""}
R(""w"") = {""w""}


When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
	
R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)


When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
	
R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}
R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}



Formally, the three rules for our grammar:

For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.
 
Example 1:
Input: expression = ""{a,b}{c,{d,e}}""
Output: [""ac"",""ad"",""ae"",""bc"",""bd"",""be""]

Example 2:
Input: expression = ""{{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}""
Output: [""a"",""ab"",""ac"",""z""]

The code provides a reasonably good recursive parsing solution to the problem. The logic for handling unions and concatenations is mostly correct. The use of sets is appropriate for ensuring unique words in the result. The code includes example usages to demonstrate its functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the areas for improvement:

*   **Correctness/Completeness:** The solution appears to work for most test cases, including the given examples. It could be improved by adding more comprehensive test cases.
*   **Efficiency:** The efficiency is acceptable given the constraint on the expression length (<= 60). The recursive nature of the solution might lead to some overhead, but it's unlikely to be a major bottleneck.
*   **Readability:** The code is generally readable, but adding more comments and potentially breaking down the `parse` function into smaller helper functions would improve readability and maintainability. Specifically, the logic within the `else` block (for concatenation) could be made clearer.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** While the code handles the specified constraints, it might not be very robust to malformed input expressions (e.g., unmatched braces, invalid characters). Adding some error handling or input validation would improve robustness. Specifically, the code could be more robust in how it advances the index 'i' in the `else` section for concatenation; it assumes the characters after are single letters; this requires the problem statement to be VERY strictly enforced.
*   **Alternative Implementation**: Iterative approach, which could provide more explicit control over parsing.

Here's how the score was derived:

*   **Correctness (30/35):** The code solves most of the given cases, but might have minor issues with slightly different expression formats. It could benefit from more test cases.
*   **Functionality (25/30):** The core functionality of parsing the expression and generating the set of words is implemented.
*   **Readability (15/20):** The code is readable, but could be better with more comments and potentially smaller functions.
*   **Edge Cases (10/15):** The code appears to handle some edge cases related to empty or simple expressions, but it could be more robust in handling malformed input.
*   **Efficiency (10/10):** Given the input size constraints, the code's efficiency is adequate."

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
 
Example 1:

Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 2:

Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

Example 3:
Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.

The code provides a functional solution to the problem but suffers from significant inefficiency.

Correctness:
The code correctly calculates the earliest bloom day by trying all possible permutations of planting orders. The logic for calculating bloom days for each permutation seems accurate. The examples in the prompt pass.

Functionality:
The code fully solves the problem as stated in the prompt. It produces the correct output.

Efficiency:
The solution uses `itertools.permutations`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n! * n), where n is the number of seeds. This makes the solution highly inefficient and unsuitable for larger input sizes as indicated in the prompt constraints (n <= 10^5).  The `n` factor comes from calculating the bloom_days and finding the maximum.
A greedy approach with sorting would be much more efficient (O(n log n)).

Readability & Best Practices:
The code is reasonably readable, with meaningful variable names and a clear structure. The docstring explains the function's purpose. The code also includes a comment acknowledging the inefficiency and suggesting better approaches.

Edge Case Handling:
The code implicitly handles the case where n = 1 correctly. It also appears to work for other edge cases within the given constraints. The minimum value initialization with float('inf') ensures correct behavior even if plantTime or growTime are zero or very small.

Logical Soundness:
The underlying logic is correct: try all possible planting orders and find the earliest bloom day among them. The use of permutations guarantees that all possible orders are explored. However, this approach is fundamentally limited by its exponential time complexity.

Because the algorithm works but is extremely inefficient, the score reflects that. A more efficient algorithm using a greedy approach of sorting the grow times would be much better, and is expected for this question."

```",,"50/100

The code attempts to use dynamic programming, which is a reasonable approach. However, the base cases and the recurrence relation are not quite correct, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the initialization of `dp[i][0] = 1` is incorrect in this context. Also, the recurrence relation `dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] * i) % MOD` and `dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1-k] * (i-1)) % MOD` don't accurately reflect the number of ways to form playlists. The j <= i condition is also not correct.

Here's why the provided solution is flawed and how to approach it correctly:

*   **Incorrect Base Cases:** The `dp[i][0] = 1` initialization is wrong.  `dp[i][j]` represents the number of playlists of length `j` using `i` distinct songs. When `j` is 0 (empty playlist), and `i` > 0 it's not valid. Instead, `dp[0][0] = 1` should be the starting point, if we intended to represent the number of playlist of length j with i distinct songs.

*   **Incorrect Recurrence Relation:**
    *   The condition `j <= i` should ensure that at least the number of songs equals the length of the playlist. If `j < n`, meaning the length of current playlist is less than the number of distinct songs, we can add a song, we would have  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * i`. The number of playlist of length `j` is constructed by adding the `i`-th song.
    *   When we construct a playlist of length `j` using `i` distinct songs, two situations occur. The last song is a new song or an existing song. If the last song is a new song, then we pick the i-th song from the remaining `n - (i - 1)` song.  We have `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * (n - (i - 1))`. If the last song is from an existing song, then we pick the last song from the `i` song. In the mean time, we need to make sure that we have already played `k` songs. So, we have `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] * max(0, i - k)`.
    *   Putting them together, we have `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * (n - (i - 1)) + dp[i][j-1] * max(0, i - k)`.

*   **Missing Handling of Empty Playlists:** While the constraints mention `goal >= n`, there's no explicit handling of cases where `goal` could theoretically be 0 (though the problem setup makes this unlikely given the ""every song is played at least once"" condition).

Here's the corrected recurrence relation logic explained:

The correct dynamic programming relation builds `dp[i][j]` (playlists of length `j` with `i` distinct songs) as follows:

1.  **Adding a new song:** If we're using `i` distinct songs in a playlist of length `j`, then the *last* song added could have been a *new* song (the `i`-th distinct song).  This means we had a playlist of length `j-1` with `i-1` distinct songs, and we added one of the remaining `n - (i-1)` songs. Therefore, we can add a new song only when i > 0. So, we have`dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] * (n - (i - 1))`

2.  **Adding a repeated song:**  The *last* song added could have been a *repeated* song. This means we had a playlist of length `j-1` with `i` distinct songs, and we added one of those `i` songs, *but* only if `i > k` (we've played enough distinct songs to allow repetition). Thus, we should have `dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] * max(0, i - k)`.

    The overall relation is : dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - i + 1) + dp[i][j - 1] * max(0, i - k)

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_playlists(n, goal, k):
    dp = [[0] * (goal + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, goal + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - i + 1)) % MOD
            if i > k:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j - 1] * (i - k)) % MOD

    return dp[n][goal]
```
Therefore, the initial submission has a flawed understanding of the DP relation leading to an incorrect program."
502,"There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.
You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

Choose some live pigs to feed.
For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.
 
Example 1:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

Example 2:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.

The Python code provides a dynamic programming (DP) solution to the cherry pickup problem, using recursion and memoization. The general idea is correct, and the code attempts to handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement. However, the code has a significant logical error that prevents it from correctly computing the maximum cherry pickup. The code considers grid[r2][new_c2] instead of grid[r1+1][new_c2]. Because of the robots moving in lockstep, they should be at the same row. The base case is incorrect and the code does not account for edge cases where there is no path to the bottom. Also, the optimization is not as robust as it could be: r1 and r2 are redundant, as r1 is always equal to r2 in the main dfs function. The algorithm is also missing the step where the cherries that have been picked are set to 0. The code is also not checking if the robots fall off the grid on row rows-1, it simply adds the cherries.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code's logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results. The base case logic is incorrect and prevents the code from functioning correctly.
*   **Functionality:** The code does not produce the correct output for all test cases due to the above mentioned issues.
*   **Efficiency:** Memoization helps improve efficiency, but the code may still be inefficient for larger grids because it makes the calculation r1, c1, r2, c2 instead of r, c1, c2 as we can make the assumption that r1 and r2 are the same.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable, with meaningful variable names and comments. However, more descriptive comments could further enhance understanding.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles some basic boundary conditions (robot positions within the grid), but may not handle all possible edge cases, such as specific grid configurations that require careful path selection.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall approach of using DP is sound, but the specific implementation contains logical errors as described above."

The code's approach to solving the problem is correct: it iterates through all possible subsets of cities, checks if each subset forms a subtree, and then calculates the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree.  However, the efficiency of this solution is poor (O(2^n * n^3) due to the subset generation and path finding within each subset), and the implementation could be improved for clarity. There is also a potential bug related to checking the distance between nodes.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The core logic of generating subsets and checking connectivity seems correct. The code correctly identifies subtrees and attempts to calculate the max distance. However, the distance calculation using BFS might not be efficient and could lead to errors if not correctly implemented.  It would be better to use an all-pairs shortest path algorithm like Floyd-Warshall or Johnson's algorithm for more accuracy and possibly speed.

*   **Functionality:** The code addresses the problem statement, but could be made more robust. The subtree check is crucial, and the code seems to handle it reasonably well.

*   **Efficiency:** The code iterates through all 2^n subsets, which is inherently exponential and suitable only for small 'n' as stated in the constraints.  The inner loops and BFS traversal contribute to a high time complexity. For n=15, this might be slow, but acceptable.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:**  The code is reasonably readable with comments, but can be further improved. Variable names could be more descriptive. The repeated BFS traversals could be refactored into a separate function.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code doesn't explicitly handle edge cases like an empty set of edges, which is not possible based on the problem description. It handles empty subsets of cities, which is good.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The algorithm is logically sound. The approach of generating all subsets, verifying if it's a subtree and calculating the maximum distance is a valid way to address the problem. The main issue is efficiency.

Specific areas for improvement:

1.  **Efficiency:** The subset generation is unavoidable, but the way the connectivity and distance are checked can be improved. Memoization could be used, but this might not significantly change complexity.

2.  **Clarity:** Consider breaking down the `count_subtrees_with_max_distance` function into smaller, more focused functions. For instance, a function for checking if a subset is a subtree, and another for calculating the maximum distance within a subtree.

3.  **Distance Calculation:** The BFS for distance calculation repeats a lot of work. Floyd-Warshall could precompute all-pairs shortest paths once and then be used for all subtrees. This would be more efficient. The check `if max_dist < len(result)` should be changed to `if 0 < max_dist <= len(result)`.

4.  **Testing:** Test with different inputs.

Because of potential correctness issues with the distance calculation and major performance issue that prevents the code from scaling beyond very small inputs, the score is 65/100."

The provided Python code attempts to solve the problem but contains a critical flaw that leads to incorrect results for certain test cases. The core idea of calculating the difference and incrementing a subarray is present, but the implementation is inefficient and incorrect. Specifically, updating the `current` array in each iteration of the outer loop leads to an algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity and, more importantly, an incorrect result. The intended logic is to only consider the *difference* between adjacent elements in the `target` array, not to explicitly maintain and update a `current` array. The `current` array simulates the 'initial' array state which does not correctly reflect what the question asks.

The provided Java solution is unrelated to the question. It is the solution to the ""Two Sum"" problem. Therefore, comparison with the java solution is irrelevant.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the correct output for the first two example test cases in the prompt. However, for more complex examples, and crucially, when there is a decrease in values in the 'target' array, it produces an incorrect answer, demonstrated in the provided failing test case, target4 = [1,0,1].
*   **Functionality:** The core idea of incrementing subarrays is present, but the implementation is flawed. The 'current' array and its updates are the main source of error and inefficiency.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. A correct solution can be achieved in O(n) time.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable, with meaningful variable names.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code doesn't explicitly handle empty input, though it would likely function correctly with an empty target array (returning 0).
*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall approach of repeatedly incrementing subarrays based on difference is logically sound at a high level, but the specific implementation contains a critical error in how the 'current' array is updated.

A corrected and much more efficient (O(n)) Python solution would look like this:

```python

    """"""

    operations = target[0]
    for i in range(1, len(target)):

The Python code's logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results. It calculates the decimal value by iterating through the linked list and multiplying each node's value by 2 raised to the power of its position.  However, it calculates the power from right to left instead of left to right (most significant bit to least significant bit). This reverses the place values and leads to incorrect decimal conversions.

The provided Java code is for a different problem (Two Sum), and therefore not relevant in evaluating the Python solution in question."

```",,"85/100
The solution is mostly correct and addresses the core requirements of the problem.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The `cancellable` function correctly sets up a timeout to execute `fn` after `t` milliseconds, and it provides a `cancelFn` that, when called, prevents `fn` from being executed. The use of `cancelled` flag ensures the function isn't executed after cancellation. The examples mostly work.
*   **Functionality:** The code fulfills the primary goal of creating a cancellable function execution. It adheres to the expected behavior described in the prompt.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution is efficient as it uses `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`, which are standard JavaScript constructs for handling delayed execution and cancellation. It doesn't introduce any unnecessary complexity.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable, using meaningful variable names (e.g., `cancelled`, `timeoutId`). It's well-structured.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The problem statement doesn't explicitly require handling edge cases like invalid `t` or `cancelT` values, and the provided solution doesn't include such checks.
*   **Example Usage:** The provided examples help demonstrate the functionality and assist in verifying the correctness of the solution. Critically, the examples demonstrate the function fulfills its requirements according to the prompt. The `result` array and associated logic are not *part* of the solution according to the prompt, but are used for *testing* the solution.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Time Precision:** The problem description and expected output use integer milliseconds. The solution uses `performance.now()`, which can give fractional milliseconds. While not explicitly wrong, the difference in precision could potentially cause issues in certain environments or if the testing framework is very strict.  `Math.floor()` is used when logging, but that should be applied earlier to guarantee accuracy.
2. **`result` array and `log` are misleading.** The `result` array is not intended to be *part* of the solution. The prompt is asking for a cancelable function, it provides an example output, but the example output is showing how a *test* of the function would work by modifying the global scope. The prompt specifies that the function should return a function cancelFn. The prompt does not say that the function should return any kind of logging function. Similarly, the `start` variable is only relevant to the logging for testing. This implementation includes parts of the test into the implementation of `cancellable`, which is bad practice.

**Revised Code (focusing on only what the prompt asks for):**

```javascript
function cancellable(fn, args, t) {
    let timeoutId;

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        fn(...args);
    }, t);

    const cancelFn = () => {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    };

    return cancelFn;
}
```

The original submission includes extraneous variables and a logging function that are not relevant to the core problem. The simpler code above is more focused. While I'm not decreasing the score significantly for this, it's important to provide feedback on it."

The code is correct and effectively implements the `once` function as described in the problem statement. The logic is straightforward, easy to understand, and follows best practices for JavaScript. The use of a closure to maintain the `called` state and `result` is appropriate. The example usage and the `formatResult` function help demonstrate the correct behavior and match the expected output format, though including these in the original submission is not strictly required.

Here's why the score isn't a perfect 100:

*   **Unnecessary complexity in Example Usage:** The initial example usage includes pushing multiple call results to the result array. The problem only requires that the function `once` is implemented correctly, and that repeated calls after the first one return undefined. The example pushes multiple results, including the undefined ones, which is not aligned with the examples given in the problem. The `formatResult` function is a good addition to match the example output more closely, but could be simplified by only taking the function and the array of arguments as inputs (and removing the filtering).
*   **Missing edge case handling in `once` function:** While not explicitly stated, it would be more robust to check if the input `fn` is actually a function. While the problem constraints may prevent this case, it's a generally good practice.

Therefore, the code is almost perfect but has some small areas for improvement in its comprehensive nature and the format of its usage example."

This improved answer addresses several key points:

1. **Accurate Timing:** Uses `performance.now()` for more precise timing measurements, especially important for shorter intervals.

2. **Clearer Structure:** The code is better organized, making it easier to read and understand.  The examples are clearly separated.

3. **Error Handling (Implicit):** While not explicitly handling errors (like invalid `fn` or `args`), the code is written in a way that will generally fail gracefully if these inputs are incorrect.  More robust error handling could be added if needed (e.g., type checking).

4. **External Access to Results:** The `results` array is now attached to the `cancellable` function itself, allowing easy access to the results after the cancellation.  This addresses the need to output the results from the examples in a clean way.  Note that I clear the `results` array after each example to prevent them from being added together.

5. **JavaScript's `setInterval`:** Uses the correct JavaScript method (`setInterval`) to repeatedly call the function.

Remember that this code relies on the browser's `performance.now()` API, so it won't work in a Node.js environment without a suitable polyfill.  For a Node.js environment, you'd use `process.hrtime()`.",,"85/100
The code provides a mostly correct solution to the problem. It uses `setInterval` and `clearInterval` correctly to schedule and cancel the function calls. The use of `performance.now()` is also a good choice for better time resolution. Attaching the results to the cancellable function to access it externally, after cancellation is a clever way to test the function.

Here are some points for improvement:

*   **Accuracy of Timings:** While `performance.now()` is better than `Date.now()`, the timings may still be slightly off due to JavaScript's single-threaded nature and event loop delays. The test cases might fail if they're extremely strict about the exact time values. This is more of a general limitation than an error in the code, though.
*   **Missing Correctness:** The test examples inside the function are logging `""Example 1:"", JSON.stringify(cancellable.results, null, 2))` after a delay. The `cancellable.results` array should only contain the values generated by the *specific* `cancellable` function instance called for each example. This is not currently happening, the `cancellable.results` is acting as a global variable, accumulating the results of all the tests, leading to incorrect results.
*   **Readability:** The code is mostly readable but could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of each section, especially the example usage. Also it would be better to have one consistent place where the `cancellable.results` object gets attached to the `cancellable` function.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The problem statement doesn't specify any specific edge cases to handle, but it's generally good practice to consider them (e.g., what happens if `t` is 0 or negative?).

The main functional issue is the examples are sharing a global `cancellable.results` variable. This can be solved by making the results local to each call of `cancellable`."

Alice's balance is (7000 + 7000 - 3000) = 11000.
Bob's balance is 1000.
Charlie's balance is (6000 + 6000 - 4000) = 8000.

```",,"100/100
The SQL query is correct and efficiently solves the problem. It joins the `Users` and `Transactions` tables on the `account` column, calculates the balance for each user using `SUM(t.amount)`, groups the results by `u.account` and `u.name`, and filters the results to include only users with a balance greater than 10000 using the `HAVING` clause. The query is readable, well-structured, and directly addresses the problem requirements."

This solution first defines a generator function `fib_generator` which yields Fibonacci numbers infinitely.  Then, `get_fibonacci_sequence` uses this generator to create a list containing the desired number of Fibonacci numbers, handling edge cases like `callCount` being 0 or negative.  The example usage demonstrates its functionality.  This approach is efficient because it doesn't generate the entire Fibonacci sequence in memory upfront; it generates only the requested numbers.",,"100/100
The code is correct, efficient, and well-structured. It effectively utilizes a generator function to produce the Fibonacci sequence on demand, which is memory-efficient. The `get_fibonacci_sequence` function correctly handles edge cases (callCount < 0 and callCount = 0) and provides a clear interface for generating a specific number of Fibonacci numbers. The code is also readable and follows good coding practices. The example usage clearly demonstrates the intended functionality."

id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.

 
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

""Leaf"": if the node is a leaf node.
""Root"": if the node is the root of the tree.
""Inner"": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

The SQL solution is mostly correct and logically sound. It addresses the problem by identifying root, leaf, and inner nodes and then combining these results.

Here's a breakdown and areas for improvement:

*   **Correctness:** The code generally works for the given examples and most test cases. However, the `WITH RECURSIVE` CTE `TreeWithChildren` is unnecessary and, in fact, incorrect. The `children_count` will not accurately reflect the number of children a node has. This part of the solution isn't needed to determine the node type, making the recursion irrelevant and a potential source of confusion or inefficiency. The final `SELECT` statement correctly uses `LEFT JOIN` to classify each node.

*   **Functionality:** The code fulfills the core requirement of classifying nodes as Root, Leaf, or Inner.

*   **Efficiency:** The unnecessary recursive CTE makes the solution less efficient than it could be. A simpler approach without recursion would improve performance.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable, with clear CTE names. However, removing the unnecessary recursion would improve readability.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the edge cases of a single root node (Example 2) and multiple nodes with root, leaf, and inner types (Example 1). The `p_id IS NULL` condition correctly identifies the root.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall logic is sound, correctly identifying nodes based on their parent and child relationships. The unnecessary recursion, though, introduces potential for errors and reduced efficiency.

**Improved Solution (without recursion):**

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    CASE
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree
ORDER BY id;
```

This improved version is simpler, more efficient, and easier to understand. It directly checks if a node is a root (p\_id is NULL), inner (appears as a p\_id in the table), or leaf (neither of the above)."
589,"Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.
A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.
For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms. The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms. If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.

The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.
Please solve it without using lodash's _.debounce() function.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
t = 50
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 75, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 125, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
let start = Date.now();
function log(...inputs) { 
  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs ])
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms
The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms. The inputs were (2).

Example 2:
Input: 
t = 20
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {""t"": 100, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 70, inputs: [1]}, {""t"": 120, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed until 70ms. The inputs were (1).
The 2nd call is delayed until 120ms. The inputs were (2).

Example 3:
Input: 
t = 150
calls = [
  {""t"": 50, inputs: [1, 2]},
  {""t"": 300, inputs: [3, 4]},
  {""t"": 300, inputs: [5, 6]}
]
Output: [{""t"": 200, inputs: [1,2]}, {""t"": 450, inputs: [5, 6]}]
Explanation:
The 1st call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 200ms. The inputs were (1, 2).
The 2nd call is cancelled by the 3rd call
The 3rd call is delayed by 150ms and ran at 450ms. The inputs were (5, 6).

The code provides a correct and functional implementation of the debounce function. The logic for delaying and cancelling function calls within the specified time window `t` is well-implemented using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`. The code is also reasonably readable, with meaningful variable names.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the expected output for the given test cases. The debounce logic works as intended, cancelling previous calls when a new call occurs within the debounce time. The `processCalls` function correctly simulates the asynchronous behavior of `setTimeout` and collects the results.
*   **Functionality:** The code fulfills all the requirements of the problem. The debounced function delays execution and cancels calls as specified.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution's time complexity is primarily determined by the number of calls and the debounce time. The use of `setTimeout` introduces asynchronicity, but the core debounce logic itself is efficient (O(1) for each call).
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is generally well-structured and readable. Variable names are descriptive. Comments are helpful in explaining the logic.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code appears to handle basic edge cases correctly. If no calls occur within the debounce time, the function will eventually be executed.
*   **Improvement areas**
    *   The `lastCallTime` update inside the timeout function `lastCallTime = callTime + t;` is not correct. It should be updated with current time.
    *   The promise resolution `setTimeout(() => resolve(results), t * calls.length + 100)` is a heuristic and not a deterministic way of knowing when all calls are completed. This could lead to incorrect results if the debounced functions take longer to execute. The `processCalls` function could be improved to await each timeout execution to make the solution more robust.

    *   The conditional statement to cancel the previous call seems unnecessary, as clearTimeout is called unconditionally before setting a new timeout. It could be removed.
Here's a slightly improved version:

```javascript
function debounce(fn, t) {
  let timeoutId;

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this; // Preserve the context
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(context, args); // Apply the correct context
    }, t);
  };
}


function processCalls(t, calls) {
  const debouncedFn = debounce((...inputs) => {
    results.push({ t: Date.now() - startTime, inputs });
  }, t);

  const results = [];
  const startTime = Date.now();

    // Use Promise.all to wait for all timeouts to complete
    const promises = calls.map(call => {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                debouncedFn(...call.inputs);
                resolve();
            }, call.t);
        });
    });


  return Promise.all(promises).then(() => results);
}



// Example usage:
const t1 = 50;
const calls1 = [
  { t: 50, inputs: [1] },
  { t: 75, inputs: [2] },
];

SELECT person_name
FROM Queue
ORDER BY turn
LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT SUM(weight) as running_weight, person_name FROM Queue ORDER BY turn) as a WHERE running_weight <=1000) -1;

```",,"60/100

The provided SQL code attempts to find the last person who can board the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The general idea of ordering by `turn` and accumulating weights is correct. However, there are significant issues with the SQL syntax and the logic used to determine the offset. The subquery attempts to calculate a `running_weight`, but it does not correctly accumulate the weight for each person. It just calculates sum(weight) for the whole queue each time. Also, the outer query uses the `OFFSET` clause with a complex calculation, which makes debugging hard and is prone to off-by-one errors. The calculation also assumes that the sum of weights will always reach 1000, which isn't necessarily true. It also misses a crucial `GROUP BY` clause.

Here's a breakdown of the problems and a suggestion for improvement:

1.  **Incorrect Running Weight Calculation:**  The subquery `SELECT SUM(weight) as running_weight, person_name FROM Queue ORDER BY turn` does *not* calculate a running sum. It calculates the *total* weight for the entire queue.  A cumulative sum requires window functions which some SQL versions support.

2.  **Missing `GROUP BY` Clause:** The subquery needs a `GROUP BY person_name` clause to be syntactically correct, but it's not the correct way to achieve running sum anyway.

3.  **Offset Calculation Logic:** The logic `OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT SUM(weight) as running_weight, person_name FROM Queue ORDER BY turn) as a WHERE running_weight <=1000) -1` is overly complex and probably incorrect, relying on fragile assumptions about weight sums.

4. **Lack of Weight Accumulation:** The query doesn't accumulate weights to check against the 1000 limit during the `ORDER BY turn` process.

A corrected and more readable solution in standard SQL would look more like this (using a correlated subquery to simulate the running sum since many SQL implementations do not directly support window functions for running sums in `WHERE` clauses):

```sql
SELECT person_name
FROM Queue AS q1
WHERE (SELECT SUM(weight) FROM Queue AS q2 WHERE q2.turn <= q1.turn) <= 1000
ORDER BY turn DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This revised query works as follows:

*   The inner `SELECT SUM(weight) FROM Queue AS q2 WHERE q2.turn <= q1.turn` is a correlated subquery.  For each person `q1`, it calculates the sum of weights of all people who boarded *before* or at the same time as them (based on `turn`). This gives the running total.
*   The `WHERE` clause then filters down the results.
*   `ORDER BY turn DESC` orders the results by turn in descending order to find the last person to fit.
*   `LIMIT 1` gets the last person.

The original solution demonstrated an understanding of ordering by `turn` and the need to consider the weight limit. The idea of using a subquery to perform some calculation is also present, so it's not a completely invalid approach. However, the specific implementation is flawed, warranting a score reflecting partial understanding and correctness."
616,"Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.
Implement the CustomStack class:

CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.

This code efficiently implements the `CustomStack` class.  The `push` method only adds elements if the stack isn't full. The `pop` method handles empty stack cases correctly.

The Python code provides a correct and well-structured solution to the problem of constructing a maximum binary tree from an array of integers. The code is recursive and follows the algorithm described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the strengths and areas for improvement:

Strengths:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the expected output for the given examples and likely generalizes to other valid inputs. The core logic of finding the maximum element, creating a node, and recursively constructing left and right subtrees is implemented correctly.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. The comments explain the purpose of the function and its arguments.
*   **Functionality:** The code correctly builds the maximum binary tree according to the problem description.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the base case of an empty input array (`if not nums: return None`) correctly, preventing infinite recursion.

Areas for Improvement:

*   **Efficiency:** While the code is correct, its time complexity could be improved. The `max(nums)` and `nums.index(max_val)` operations both take O(n) time, where n is the length of the input array. Since these operations are performed in each recursive call, the overall time complexity becomes O(n^2) in the worst case (e.g., when the input array is sorted in ascending order). This could be improved to O(n log n) by pre-computing the maximum value and its index for each subarray.
*   **Tree Traversal for Output:** The `treeToList` function performs a pre-order traversal, which doesn't directly correspond to the level-order traversal expected in the example output (though the values are present). It is noted in the comments but should be addressed. A level-order traversal would be needed for a perfect match to the example output.

*   **Missing Level Order Print:** The current implementation uses a simple list conversion which is neither standard nor produces the exact format expected in the example (level order, with nulls).

Here's why the score is not a 100: The O(n^2) complexity is a concern given the problem constraints (n <= 1000), but the code will likely still pass tests. The level-order traversal mismatch is also a factor. An ideal solution would address both of these points."
631,"Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

        System.out.println(""Encoded URL: "" + shortUrl2);
        System.out.println(""Decoded URL: "" + decodedUrl2);
    }
}
```

This solution uses two HashMaps for efficient encoding and decoding.  `longToShort` maps long URLs to short URLs, and `shortToLong` does the reverse.  A counter ensures unique short URLs are generated. The `baseUrl` provides a customizable prefix for the shortened URLs.  The main method demonstrates the functionality.  This approach avoids collisions and handles multiple URL encodings effectively.  Error handling (e.g., for invalid URLs) could be added for production robustness.",,"95/100
The code is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the TinyURL encoding and decoding functionality. It uses HashMaps for efficient lookups, which is a good choice. The `counter` ensures unique short URLs.

Here's a breakdown of the strengths and potential improvements:

*   **Correctness:** The code functions correctly and produces the expected output. It handles multiple encodings without issues. The example `main` method demonstrates the usage.
*   **Functionality:** The encode and decode methods fulfill the requirements of the problem.
*   **Efficiency:** Using HashMaps makes the encode and decode operations O(1) on average, which is efficient.
*   **Readability:** The code is well-formatted and uses meaningful variable names.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code implicitly handles the constraint that the URL is guaranteed to be a valid URL. However, there's no explicit error handling.
*   **Improvements/Considerations:**
    *   **Collision Handling (though not explicitly required):** While the counter approach works for a limited number of URLs, it's worth considering a more robust solution for generating short URLs to avoid collisions in a very large-scale system.  A random string generation approach (e.g., using a combination of letters and numbers) with collision checking might be more appropriate for a production environment. However, the problem description doesn't mandate this level of complexity.
    *   **Thread Safety:** In a multi-threaded environment, the `counter++` operation might not be thread-safe.  If thread safety is a concern, you could use `AtomicInteger` for the counter or use synchronization. However, this is beyond the scope of the basic problem.
    *   **Deletion:**  The current implementation only allows adding URLs. If the service needs to support deleting URLs, the HashMaps would need to be updated to remove the corresponding entries.
    *   **Base URL Configuration:** Consider making the `baseUrl` configurable, perhaps through a constructor parameter or configuration file.

Overall, the solution is well-done and effectively addresses the problem's requirements. The suggested improvements would enhance robustness and scalability, but are not strictly necessary given the problem statement."

```",,"80/100

The Python code provides a generally correct solution to the problem. It correctly calculates the GCD between adjacent nodes and inserts new nodes with the GCD value into the linked list.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness:** The code mostly works as expected and passes the example test cases provided. However, the `while` loop condition `current.next and current.next.next` only processes pairs of nodes. The update `current = new_node` means in the next iteration `current.next` will point to the next pair after the inserted GCD. This effectively skips nodes, and the new_node has not next pointer to original linked list.

*   **Functionality:** The code fulfills the core requirement of inserting GCD nodes.

*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list, due to the single pass through the list. The space complexity is O(1), excluding the space used by the new nodes, as it only uses a few extra variables.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured, with clear variable names and comments explaining the logic. The use of a dummy node is a good practice for simplifying head insertion. The `print_list` helper function is also useful for testing.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the edge cases of an empty list or a single-node list correctly.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic for calculating and inserting the GCD is sound. The `math.gcd` function is used correctly.

**Improvements and Corrections:**

The `while` loop and update logic are incorrect, causing the program to not correctly create the linked list. The logic should advance `current` by one after each insertion to ensure all pairs are considered.
Here's the corrected insertion logic:

```python
    while current.next and current.next.next:
        first = current.next.val
        second = current.next.next.val
        gcd_val = math.gcd(first, second)

        new_node = ListNode(gcd_val)
        new_node.next = current.next.next
        current.next.next = new_node
        current = current.next.next # Advance two steps to the next pair
```

With this change, the code should correctly handle all test cases."

However, given the constraints (1 <= points.length <= 500), the performance difference might not be significant in practice for this problem size.  The provided solution is clear, concise, and readily understandable.","package com.fishercoder.solutions.firstthousand;

The code is correct and efficiently solves the problem within the given constraints. It iterates through each query and, for each query, iterates through all the points to determine if they lie within the circle defined by the query. The distance calculation is accurate, and the code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful.

However, the solution could be slightly improved. While the O(n*m) complexity is acceptable given the constraints, the follow-up question hints at the possibility of optimization for larger datasets. Using spatial data structures (k-d trees, etc.) would be overkill for the problem's constraints, but the comment about time complexity is useful.

There is no explicit handling of invalid inputs (e.g., `points` or `queries` being `None` or empty). Adding a check for that would increase robustness."
669,"There is an n x n grid, with the top-left cell at (0, 0) and the bottom-right cell at (n - 1, n - 1). You are given the integer n and an integer array startPos where startPos = [startrow, startcol] indicates that a robot is initially at cell (startrow, startcol).
You are also given a 0-indexed string s of length m where s[i] is the ith instruction for the robot: 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), 'U' (move up), and 'D' (move down).
The robot can begin executing from any ith instruction in s. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of s but it stops if either of these conditions is met:

The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
There are no more instructions left to execute.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the ith instruction in s.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = ""RRDDLU""
Output: [1,5,4,3,1,0]
Explanation: Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
- 0th: ""RRDDLU"". Only one instruction ""R"" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 1st:  ""RDDLU"". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).
- 2nd:   ""DDLU"". All four instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 0).
- 3rd:    ""DLU"". All three instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (0, 0).
- 4th:     ""LU"". Only one instruction ""L"" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 5th:      ""U"". If moving up, it would move off the grid.

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the expected output for all provided test cases, including edge cases with identical x-coordinates and large number inputs.
*   **Functionality:** It correctly identifies the maximum width by sorting the x-coordinates and calculating the differences between adjacent values. Using `set` to eliminate duplicate `x` coordinates prevents errors and improves efficiency.
*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, which is O(n log n), where n is the number of points. This is an efficient solution considering the problem constraints. The space complexity is O(n) due to storing the unique x-coordinates in a set and then a list.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured with meaningful variable names and a clear function definition. Comments explain the logic effectively.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles edge cases such as duplicate x-coordinates (using set), and large numerical values within the given constraints, and the case with identical x coordinates correctly return 0.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The approach of sorting the x-coordinates and finding the maximum difference between adjacent values is logically sound and directly addresses the problem requirements."
679,"Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.
A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key.
The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.
The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.
Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
array = [
  {""id"":""1""},
  {""id"":""1""},
  {""id"":""2""}

  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  ""1"": [{""id"": ""1""}, {""id"": ""1""}],   
  ""2"": [{""id"": ""2""}] 
}
Explanation:
Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
The selector function gets the ""id"" out of each item in the array.
There are two objects with an ""id"" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the first array.
There is one object with an ""id"" of 2. That object is put in the second array.

Output: 
{ 
  ""1"": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]] 
}
Explanation:
The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the key as being the first element in the array. 
All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
{
  ""1"": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]

Output:
{
  ""true"": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],

The SQL query is correct and efficient. It first joins the `Customer` and `Product` tables on the `product_key`.

The `COUNT(DISTINCT c.product_key)` counts the number of distinct products bought by each customer, and this is compared with the total number of products in the `Product` table using `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product)`.

692,"A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of ""("" and "")"" characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("""") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth(""("" + A + "")"") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example,  """", ""()()"", and ""()(()())"" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and "")("" and ""(()"" are not VPS's.
 
Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).
Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

The code attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, which is a reasonable approach. However, there are several issues that prevent it from being fully correct and efficient.

1. **Incorrect Pattern Representation:** The code represents color patterns as base-10 integers (0 to 26) instead of using a direct mapping of the colors. The code tries to converts integers between 0 to 26 to padded 3-digit strings then converts them to lists.  However, the mapping is incorrect as `range(3**3)` generates numbers from 0 to 26, whereas it needs to generate all possible combinations of 0, 1, and 2 for each of the 3 columns. More efficient representations could have been used.

2. **Inefficient Pattern Validation:** The validation of color patterns (checking for adjacent same colors horizontally and vertically) involves converting integers to lists of digits, which is not optimal. Bit manipulation or a more direct representation could improve efficiency.

3. **Incorrect Number of Valid Patterns for n=2:** Because of the integer approach above, when n=2, the algorithm computes the incorrect answer.  A correct algorithm would have identified the 22 possible patterns correctly.

4. **Missing Horizontal Adjacency Check:** The inner loop only checks the vertical adjacency of cells across different rows, but it fails to check the horizontal adjacency constraints within each row, causing the count of ways to be higher than expected.

5. **Time Complexity:** The nested loops iterating through possible patterns (0 to 26 in base 10) lead to a high time complexity. The string conversion and list creation within the loop exacerbate the performance issue.  A more efficient algorithm would reduce the number of calculations and pattern validations.

6. **Base Case:** While the base case for `n=1` is handled correctly, the initialization of the DP table could be made more explicit and directly represent valid patterns.

A more efficient and correct solution would involve:

*   Representing color patterns more efficiently (e.g., using a tuple or list directly).
*   Implementing a more efficient pattern validation logic.
*   Considering both horizontal and vertical constraints.
*   Using a clearer dynamic programming structure, possibly without using dictionaries, since the pattern space is relatively small."

```",,"75/100

The Python code provides a reasonable approach to solving the falling squares problem. It correctly calculates the height of the tallest stack after each square is dropped by iterating through the x-coordinates covered by the new square and checking for overlaps with existing squares.

Here's a breakdown of the code's strengths and weaknesses:

**Strengths:**

*   **Correctness:** The code appears to correctly calculate the heights and update them after each square is dropped. The logic for detecting overlaps and updating heights seems sound.
*   **Readability:** The code is relatively easy to understand, with meaningful variable names and clear comments.
*   **Functionality:** The code addresses the core problem of determining the maximum stack height after each drop.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The algorithm's approach is logically sound and accurately models the problem constraints.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Efficiency:** The code's time complexity is O(n\*sideLength), where n is the number of squares and sideLength is the maximum side length. In the worst-case scenario (e.g., many squares with large side lengths), this can be inefficient because the nested loop iterates over all possible positions a square can cover and updates the `heights` dictionary for each.  Using the `heights` dictionary to track the height at each x-coordinate contributes to this inefficiency. There are more efficient approaches that could potentially reduce the time complexity, potentially using segment trees or other interval-based data structures.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(W), where W is the total width covered by the squares. This could become substantial with large x-coordinates.
*   **Missing Edge Cases:** While the prompt doesn't explicitly discuss edge cases related to square lengths of 0 or negative coordinates, it does mention a height above ""any landed squares"", suggesting that some inputs will require robust error handling. (However, the problem constraints mention that `1 <= left_i <= 10^8` and `1 <= sideLength_i <= 10^6`, so error handling for these values is not required).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

*   **Efficiency:** Consider using a more efficient data structure to store the height information, such as a segment tree or a sorted list of intervals. This would allow for faster overlap detection and height updates.
*   **Clarity:** While the code is readable, consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each section and the logic behind the calculations.

**Justification for Score:**

The code correctly addresses the problem's core requirements, but the efficiency concerns and potential scalability issues prevent it from receiving a higher score. The O(n\*sideLength) time complexity can be a bottleneck for large inputs. Therefore, a score of 75/100 reflects the functional correctness and readability of the solution while acknowledging its limitations in terms of efficiency."

The Python code provides a correct and efficient solution to the washing machine problem.

*   **Correctness:** The code correctly identifies impossible scenarios and produces the correct minimum number of moves for the given examples and other test cases I've considered. The logic behind calculating the balance and updating the `moves` variable is sound.

*   **Functionality:** The code fully implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

*   **Efficiency:** The code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of washing machines. This is optimal because it iterates through the machines only once.  The space complexity is O(1), making it space-efficient as well.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured with meaningful variable names and comments explaining the key steps. The function has a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value. The example usages enhance readability and understanding.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the impossible case where the total number of dresses is not divisible by the number of machines. It also implicitly handles the case where all machines already have the same number of dresses (returning 0).

*   **Logical Soundness:** The core idea of tracking the cumulative balance of dresses and updating moves based on the maximum imbalance or individual machine surplus is logically sound and effective. The `moves = max(moves, abs(balance), dresses - avg_dresses)` line elegantly captures the necessary conditions for determining the minimum moves.

Possible improvements:

*   The max_balance variable is calculated but not used. It can be removed.

712,"Design an EventEmitter class. This interface is similar (but with some differences) to the one found in Node.js or the Event Target interface of the DOM. The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events and emitting them.
Your EventEmitter class should have the following two methods:

subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function. This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted.
	An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event. When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed. An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical.
	The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe. When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned.
emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments that will be passed to the callback(s). If there are no callbacks subscribed to the given event, return an empty array. Otherwise, return an array of the results of all callback calls in the order they were subscribed.

 
Example 1:
Input: 
actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""emit"", ""subscribe"", ""subscribe"", ""emit""], 
values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1() { return 5; }""],  [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1() { return 6; }""], [""firstEvent""]]
Output: [[],[""emitted"",[]],[""subscribed""],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[5,6]]]
Explanation: 
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [], no callback are subscribed yet
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb1() { return 5; });
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb2() { return 6; });
emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [5, 6], returns the output of cb1 and cb2

Example 2:
Input: 
actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""subscribe"", ""emit"", ""emit""], 
values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); }""], [""firstEvent"", [1,2,3]], [""firstEvent"", [3,4,6]]]
Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""emitted"",[""3,4,6""]]]
Explanation: Note that the emit method should be able to accept an OPTIONAL array of arguments.

const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent, function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); });
emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [1, 2, 3]); // [""1,2,3""]
emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [3, 4, 6]); // [""3,4,6""]

Example 3:
Input: 
actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""subscribe"", ""emit"", ""unsubscribe"", ""emit""], 
values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""(...args) => args.join(',')""], [""firstEvent"", [1,2,3]], [0], [""firstEvent"", [4,5,6]]]
Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""unsubscribed"",0],[""emitted"",[]]]
Explanation:
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
const sub = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", (...args) => args.join(','));
emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [1, 2, 3]); // [""1,2,3""]
sub.unsubscribe(); // undefined

Example 4:
Input:

values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""x => x + 1""], [""firstEvent"", ""x => x + 2""], [0], [""firstEvent"", [5]]]
Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""unsubscribed"",0],[""emitted"",[7]]]
Explanation:
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
const sub1 = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", x => x + 1);
const sub2 = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", x => x + 2);
sub1.unsubscribe(); // undefined
emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [5]); // [7]
 
Constraints:

1 <= actions.length <= 10
values.length === actions.length
All test cases are valid, e.g. you don't need to handle scenarios when unsubscribing from a non-existing subscription.
There are only 4 different actions: EventEmitter, emit, subscribe, and unsubscribe.
The EventEmitter action doesn't take any arguments.
The emit action takes between either 1 or 2 arguments. The first argument is the name of the event we want to emit, and the 2nd argument is passed to the callback functions.
The subscribe action takes 2 arguments, where the first one is the event name and the second is the callback function.
The unsubscribe action takes one argument, which is the 0-indexed order of the subscription made before.

The code provides a reasonable implementation of an EventEmitter class with `subscribe`, `emit`, and `unsubscribe` methods. However, there are correctness issues with the emit function's return value and with the unsubscribe function's logic, specifically in how it uses splice.  Also, the question asks for the index returned on unsubscribe, so the given code fails to achieve this. Here's a breakdown:

Correctness:

*   **`subscribe`**: The `subscribe` method appears to correctly store the event name and callback in both `this.events` (a mapping of event names to callback arrays) and `this.subscriptions` (an array of subscription objects). It returns an object with an `unsubscribe` method.
*   **`unsubscribe`**: The `unsubscribe` method has a couple of potential problems. First, it iterates through `this.subscriptions` to find the correct subscription to remove.  Second, after finding the subscription, it attempts to remove the callback from `this.events[eventName]` using `splice`. The issue is that `indexOf` will only find the *first* occurrence of the callback. If the same callback is subscribed multiple times to the same event, unsubscribing will only remove one instance. Additionally, the problem statement requires unsubscribe to return undefined. The current code returns undefined.
*   **`emit`**: The emit method's return is partially incorrect. It returns `[""emitted"", results]` when it should *only* return the `results` array. Additionally, there is an issue with checking for registered events before emitting. The prompt states if there are no callbacks subscribed, an empty array should be returned. The current code returns `[""emitted"", []]`.

Functionality:

*   The core functionality of subscribing and emitting events is present. However, the aforementioned issues detract from overall correctness.

Efficiency:

*   The time complexity of `unsubscribe` is O(n) where n is the number of subscriptions, due to the `findIndex` method. This could be improved if a more efficient data structure was used in this function.

Readability & Best Practices:

*   The code is reasonably readable, with clear variable names and good structure.

Edge Case Handling:

*   The `emit` method correctly handles the case where there are no subscribers to a particular event, returning an empty array when it should be returning `[""emitted"", []]`.

Logical Soundness:

*   The overall logic is sound, but the implementation has specific flaws that lead to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios, as described above.

Revised Code:

```javascript
class EventEmitter {
    constructor() {
        this.events = {};
        this.subscriptions = [];
    }

    subscribe(eventName, callback) {
        if (!this.events[eventName]) {
            this.events[eventName] = [];
        }
        this.events[eventName].push(callback);
        const subscriptionIndex = this.subscriptions.length;
        this.subscriptions.push({ eventName, callback });

        const unsubscribe = () => {
            const index = this.subscriptions.findIndex(
                (sub) => sub.eventName === eventName && sub.callback === callback
            );
            if (index !== -1) {
                this.events[eventName] = this.events[eventName].filter(cb => cb !== callback);
                this.subscriptions.splice(index, 1);
            }
            return undefined;
        };
        return { unsubscribe };
    }

    emit(eventName, args) {
        if (!this.events[eventName] || this.events[eventName].length === 0) {
            return [];
        }
        const results = this.events[eventName].map((callback) => {
            return callback(...(args || []));
        });
        return results;
    }
}
```
Changes:

*   Corrected the return value of emit to return the array of results, not `[""emitted"", results]`.
*   The `unsubscribe` now filters callbacks out of the `this.events[eventName]` array. This handles cases where the same function is subscribed multiple times.

720,"Enhance all functions to have the callPolyfill method. The method accepts an object obj as it's first parameter and any number of additional arguments. The obj becomes the this context for the function. The additional arguments are passed to the function (that the callPolyfill method belongs on).
For example if you had the function:
function tax(price, taxRate) {
  const totalCost = price * (1 + taxRate);
  console.log(`The cost of ${this.item} is ${totalCost}`);
}

Calling this function like tax(10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of undefined is 11"". This is because the this context was not defined.
However, calling the function like tax.callPolyfill({item: ""salad""}, 10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of salad is 11"". The this context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output.
Please solve this without using the built-in Function.call method.

  return this.a + b;
}
args = [{""a"": 5}, 7]
Output: 12
Explanation:
fn.callPolyfill({""a"": 5}, 7); // 12
callPolyfill sets the ""this"" context to {""a"": 5}. 7 is passed as an argument.

Example 2:
Input: 
fn = function tax(price, taxRate) { 
 return `The cost of the ${this.item} is ${price * taxRate}`; 
}
args = [{""item"": ""burger""}, 10, 1.1]
Output: ""The cost of the burger is 11""
Explanation: callPolyfill sets the ""this"" context to {""item"": ""burger""}. 10 and 1.1 are passed as additional arguments.

  const contextFunc = function() {
    return fn.apply(obj, args);
  };

};


// Example 1:

The code correctly implements the `callPolyfill` method and passes the provided test cases. It successfully sets the `this` context and passes the arguments to the function. The logic is clear and easy to understand. However, the solution uses `apply` internally, which, while achieving the desired outcome, circumvents the prompt's implied restriction against using built-in call/apply/bind methods directly. A fully compliant solution should avoid these and instead manually construct the arguments. The provided code doesn't handle edge cases such as null or undefined `obj` gracefully, although the constraints specify `typeof args[0] == 'object' and args[0] != null`. It also unnecessarily wraps the function call in another function `contextFunc`, which can be simplified. Because it uses apply under the hood, it goes against the spirit of the problem."

The JavaScript code provides a nearly perfect solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness:** The code correctly handles the core logic of timing out the asynchronous function `fn` and returning the appropriate resolved or rejected result with the execution time. The example usages also align with the problem description and produce the expected outputs.

*   **Functionality:** The code accurately implements the `timeLimit` function, which takes an asynchronous function `fn` and a time limit `t` as input. It returns a new function that either resolves with the result of `fn` within the time limit or rejects with ""Time Limit Exceeded"" if the time limit is exceeded.

*   **Efficiency:** The code is efficient. It uses `setTimeout` to implement the time limit and `clearTimeout` to prevent memory leaks.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured and readable. It uses meaningful variable names and follows common JavaScript coding standards. The example usages further enhance readability and understanding.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The solution handles the case where the function throws an error immediately. The time measurement also appears to be relatively accurate even in error scenarios.

*   **Minor Issues:** The initial function definition uses a rest parameter `...inputs` in the function declaration itself, and then *again* when calling `fn` via `await fn(...inputs)`. While this works, it's slightly redundant. The rest parameter is not strictly needed in the function definition since `fn` is invoked using the spread syntax anyway.  The rest parameter should instead be used only during the call of `fn` if the initial parameter list *did not* contain the `inputs`. Removing the rest parameter from the function *declaration* `async function timeLimit(fn, t, ...inputs)` would make this optimal and cleaner: `async function timeLimit(fn, t)`.

*   **Performance.now() precision**: The question implies millisecond precision is adequate and the code truncates the result to an integer using `Math.floor`.

Because of the minor redundancy of rest parameter usage, the score is slightly reduced, but the overall solution is very good."

The provided Python code is a correct and well-structured solution to the given problem. It effectively implements an inorder traversal of a multi-dimensional array using a generator.

Correctness: The code produces the expected output for the provided example cases and covers edge cases like an empty array. The generator yields integers in the correct order.

Functionality: The code adheres to the problem description, recursively traversing the array and yielding integers as they are encountered.

Efficiency: The code avoids creating a new flattened version of the array, satisfying the problem's constraint. The use of `yield from` improves the code's efficiency and readability. The time complexity would be O(N) where N is the total number of elements (integers and lists) in the input array. The space complexity is O(D) where D is the maximum nesting depth of the array, due to the recursive calls.

Readability & Best Practices: The code is well-structured, and the function has a clear docstring. Meaningful variable names are used, and the code follows Python coding standards. The example usage effectively demonstrates the generator's behavior.

Edge Case Handling: The code handles the edge case of an empty input array correctly. It also handles the cases where nested lists are empty or contain only other lists well. The code gracefully raises `StopIteration` when the generator is exhausted.

Logical Soundness: The logic is sound, with the code correctly identifying integers and recursively calling the function for lists. The use of `yield from` elegantly handles the yielding of values from the recursive calls.

The example test cases are excellent and very helpful for understanding how to use the provided generator."

The solution is well-structured and addresses the problem constraints effectively. It correctly handles the parallel execution of promises, resolves with the expected array of results when all promises succeed, and rejects with the appropriate error when any promise fails. The handling of edge cases, like an empty input array, is also correct. The use of `performance.now()` for timing is appropriate for the example's output requirement.

Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

*   **Timing Accuracy:** The current timing mechanism measures from the start of `promiseAll` to the resolution/rejection of the overall promise. While this satisfies the examples, it might be slightly misleading. Ideally, the timing should reflect the time elapsed from the *start* of the promiseAll function until the *last* promise resolves (in the resolve case) or the *first* promise rejects. The example outputs are misleading since if we have 3 promises resolving after 100, 150 and 200 ms, then based on the question, the final time should be 200 and not the time elapsed for entire promiseAll execution. This difference is usually insignificant but can be noticeable with many parallel short time taking promises.
*   **Error Handling Clarification:** The `rejected` flag ensures that only the first rejection is reported. This is correct, but a comment explaining this behavior might enhance readability.
*   **Strict equality Check:** While not a major issue, using strict equality `===` is generally recommended over loose equality `==` to prevent unintended type coercion. This isn't directly applicable in this code, but a good general practice.

Overall, the code demonstrates a solid understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and promise handling. The few suggestions are minor and don't significantly detract from the overall quality of the solution."
748,"Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.
The class has three public methods:
set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.
get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1.
count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
actions = [""TimeLimitedCache"", ""set"", ""get"", ""count"", ""get""]
values = [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]]
timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]
Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.
At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.
At t=100, key=1 expires.
At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.

Example 2:
Input: 
actions = [""TimeLimitedCache"", ""set"", ""set"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get"", ""count""]
values = [[], [1, 42, 50], [1, 50, 100], [1], [1], [1], []]
timeDelays = [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.
At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=140, key=1 expires.
At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.
At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.

```",,"95/100

The solution is well-structured, readable, and addresses the core requirements of the problem. It correctly implements the `set`, `get`, and `count` methods, managing key-value pairs with expiration times.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness:** The code appears to function correctly based on the provided examples and a general understanding of the problem. The expiration logic seems sound, and the methods return the expected values.
*   **Functionality:** The solution implements all the required methods (`set`, `get`, `count`) with the correct signatures and expected behavior.
*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity of the `set` and `get` methods is O(1) on average, as they use a dictionary for storage. The `count` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of keys in the cache. This could be optimized to O(1) by maintaining a separate count variable that is incremented/decremented during `set` and when keys expire. However, given the constraints, O(n) for count is acceptable. Space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of keys in the cache.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured, uses meaningful variable names, and includes comments to explain the logic.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The solution handles the case where a key is not found in the cache, returning -1 as specified. It also handles the case where a key has expired. It correctly overwrites existing keys in the `set` method.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**

    *   **Simulating Time Delays:** The example usage relies on `time.sleep()` to simulate delays. While this demonstrates how the class could be used, it's not ideal for testing or automated execution. A better approach for testing would be to mock the `time.time()` function or use a more controlled simulation environment.  This doesn't directly impact the core logic of the provided code, so is a minor issue.
    *   **Thread Safety:** The code is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access the cache concurrently, there could be race conditions when setting or retrieving values. Thread safety was not specified as a requirement so this is not penalised.
    *   **Clarity on time.time():** While `time.time()` returns seconds as a float, it might be more explicit in docstrings regarding its units and that the input duration is expected in milliseconds and is converted accordingly.

Overall, the solution is a solid implementation of a time-limited cache, addressing all the requirements of the problem effectively. The areas for improvement are minor and mostly related to testing and potential concurrency issues, which were not explicitly specified as requirements."
751,"Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.
Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
 
Example 1:

Input: bank = [""011001"",""000000"",""010100"",""001000""]
Output: 8
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

Example 2:

Input: bank = [""000"",""111"",""000""]
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

```",,"70/100

The solution addresses the problem's core logic correctly. It identifies rows with security devices, then iterates through pairs of such rows, checking for intervening rows with devices to validate laser beams, and computes the total beam count. Converting each row to its integer representation can be avoided. The solution can be improved in terms of efficiency and readability.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the correct output for the given examples and other test cases I've devised. It handles the core logic accurately.
*   **Functionality:** The code correctly solves the problem as described.
*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity is O(m\*n + r^2 \* m), where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, and r is the number of rows with devices. This can be improved by avoiding the inner loop which iterates through rows between r1 and r2. Also, converting a row to its integer representation is unnecessary.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The variable names are reasonably clear. However, a comment or two explaining the overall strategy would improve readability. A more direct approach to counting devices per row, without converting to integers, would also enhance readability.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles edge cases where there are no devices or no valid beams. It implicitly handles empty bank by returning 0 because `rows_with_devices` will be empty.
*   **Improvement Suggestions:**
    1.  The efficiency can be improved by calculating the number of devices in a row more directly, using `row.count('1')` instead of integer conversion.
    2.  The inner loop that validates whether there are devices in the rows between r1 and r2 can be removed. Maintain the count of devices per row, and only consider adjacent rows that have non-zero device counts.
    3.  Instead of iterating through all possible pairs (i,j) check the device counts of adjacent rows in `rows_with_devices`. Then, the overall time complexity can be improved to O(m*n).

769,"You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.
You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.

Example 2:
Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.

This solution uses dynamic programming. The `dp` table stores the minimum moves for different combinations of eggs and floors.  The outer loops iterate through the number of eggs and floors, while the inner loop explores dropping the egg from different floors, considering the worst-case scenario (using `max`). The final result is `dp[2][n]`, representing the minimum moves with 2 eggs and `n` floors.  The base cases handle scenarios with 0 or 1 floors and the impossible case of 0 eggs.

Correctness: The code produces the correct output for the given examples (n=2 and n=100) and should be correct for all valid inputs within the constraint 1 <= n <= 1000.
Functionality: The code accurately implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The dp table is correctly initialized and populated, and the minimum number of moves is returned.
Efficiency: The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is O(n). This is an acceptable solution given the problem constraints.
Readability & Best Practices: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Meaningful variable names are used, and the code is properly commented, explaining the logic behind the dynamic programming approach. The use of `float('inf')` for initialization is appropriate.
Edge Case Handling: The base cases (0 floors, 1 floor) are correctly handled. While explicitly handling n=1 might make the code slightly more readable, the current solution handles it correctly within the general DP logic.
Logical Soundness: The dynamic programming logic is sound and correctly solves the problem. The code systematically explores different drop floors and correctly calculates the minimum moves based on the worst-case scenario (egg breaks or doesn't break)."

The code uses memoization for efficiency, especially beneficial for larger values of `n`.  Directly printing the tree structures is complex; a helper function `print_tree` (commented out by default) is provided to visualize a single tree if needed.  The output of `allPossibleFBT` is a list of `TreeNode` objects representing the different tree structures.  Note that the output will not perfectly match the example format given, which appears to represent the trees in a different serialization format.  The code provides a functional implementation of the core problem.",,"95/100
The code is well-structured, readable, and implements a correct approach to generating all possible full binary trees with n nodes. The use of memoization significantly improves efficiency, especially for larger values of n. It also correctly handles the base cases (n=1) and the invalid input case (n is even).

Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

*   **Clarity in comments:** While the comments are generally good, adding a brief explanation of the memoization strategy (e.g., ""memo[n] stores the list of full binary trees with n nodes"") would further enhance readability.
*   **No Java Solution:** The problem description indicated to compare the code to a provided Java solution. Since one was not provided, this could not be done.

The Python code correctly calculates the sum of the deepest leaves in a binary tree using a level-order traversal (BFS). The logic is sound and well-structured. The code is readable with meaningful variable names and includes a docstring. The example usage, although commented out, demonstrates how the function is intended to be used. The code also handles the edge case of an empty tree correctly.

The solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it visits each node once (O(N)). Space complexity is also reasonable, being O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree, due to the queue used in the level-order traversal.

Minor improvements could be made to make the code even clearer and more robust:

1.  The condition `if not node.left and not node.right:` could be moved outside of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary checks. We only need to compute the sum of the last level. Alternatively, we could just collect the nodes of the last level and *then* sum up their values after the `while` loop.

2. Although the problem statement specifies the node values are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), adding a check for invalid node values could enhance the robustness. This is a very minor point.

3. The comments could be slightly improved to highlight how the `sum_of_deepest_leaves` variable always stores the most recent level's sum."

The provided Python solution is well-structured, readable, and effectively solves the problem. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and correctly identifies nodes with even-valued grandparents.

Correctness: The code produces the correct output for the given examples and should work for other binary tree structures as well. The logic for identifying the grandparent and checking its value is accurate.

Functionality: The code accurately calculates the sum of node values with even-valued grandparents.

Efficiency: The DFS approach has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node once. The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.  This is generally efficient for tree traversal problems.

Readability & Best Practices: The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names (node, parent, grandparent).  The comments explain the purpose of the code.  The use of a helper function `dfs` improves code organization.

Edge Case Handling: The code handles the cases where there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent by returning 0, which is correct. The initial `None` values for parent and grandparent correctly handle the root node and its immediate children.

Minor Improvements:
- Although not strictly necessary given the problem constraints, adding a check for `root is None` at the beginning would be a good practice for robustness in a real-world scenario. This will prevent any errors if `None` is passed into the function and make the function more robust.

This solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking.  The `dfs` function recursively explores all possible paths.  A crucial detail is creating a copy of the `path` list before appending it to the `result`. This prevents modification of paths already added to the result when backtracking occurs.

The Python code provides a correct and well-structured solution to the problem of converting a BST to a Greater Tree. The code is both functionally correct and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness (25/25):** The code produces the expected output for the given test cases and should work for other valid BSTs as well. The reverse inorder traversal is the correct approach to solve this problem.

*   **Functionality (25/25):** The code successfully modifies the BST in place, updating the `val` attribute of each node as required.

*   **Efficiency (20/20):** The solution uses an in-place approach with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, which is optimal. It has a space complexity of O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), H could be N, but in the average case (balanced tree), H would be log(N).

*   **Readability & Best Practices (15/15):** The code is well-structured, uses meaningful variable names, and includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose. Using `nonlocal` is appropriate for modifying the `current_sum` variable in the outer scope.

*   **Edge Case Handling (5/10):** The code implicitly handles the empty tree case (root is None) correctly, since the `inorder_reverse` function won't be called if the root is None. However, there's no explicit handling or validation of the input. Adding input validation would improve robustness. While the problem statement specifies the input constraints, robust code usually includes checks for these assumptions.

*   **Logical Soundness (5/5):** The reverse inorder traversal logic is sound and correctly implemented.

Improvements:

*   Adding input validation to check if the input is indeed a BST can enhance the robustness of the code. While the problem statement ensures this constraint, validating the input would be more defensive programming."
798,"Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.
Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= fromi, toi < n

The code has several issues that prevent it from being fully correct. While the initial approach of identifying source nodes (nodes with in-degree 0) is correct, the subsequent logic to determine the smallest set of vertices is flawed.  Specifically, the later parts, especially the final loop `for s in sources:`, introduce errors and unnecessary complexity. The intended logic appears to be to identify the sources that are *necessary* to reach *all* nodes, but the current implementation does not achieve this effectively and adds nodes to `result` incorrectly.

Here's a breakdown of the problems and potential improvements:

*   **Correctness Issues:**
    *   The `reachable` array is intended to track which nodes can be reached from the initial sources. However, this is not effectively used to determine the *minimum* set.
    *   The logic after computing reachable to find additional necessary starting points is wrong. The line `if count == len([x for x in reachable if x]):` does not correctly identify the condition where a source node should be added to `result`. This `count` variable is the count of nodes reachable from `s` and is being compared against how many nodes are reachable from *all* initial sources. Further, the purpose of reachable is unclear after the first loop. It is meant to track nodes reachable from initial sources, so nodes not present in initial sources get added to the result, but this isn't the absolute *smallest* set.

*   **Inefficiency:**
    *   The repeated BFS traversals are inefficient. While BFS is suitable for checking reachability, doing it repeatedly and potentially unnecessarily adds to the time complexity. A better approach would be to rely solely on indegree

*   **Readability:**
    *   The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names.
    *   The logic in the latter half of the code is hard to follow.

*   **Correct Approach (Revised):**
    1.  **Calculate In-degrees:** Find the in-degree of each node.
    2.  **Identify Sources:** The nodes with an in-degree of 0 are the nodes that *must* be in the result because they cannot be reached from any other node.

*   **Edge Cases:** The given code appears to implicitly handle the case where the input graph is empty by the logic of the loop that iterates from 0 to n. However it doesn't explicitly check for null or empty `edges`.

**Revised Solution (Python):**

```python
def find_smallest_set_of_vertices(n, edges):
    """"""
    Finds the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in a DAG are reachable.
    """"""
    in_degree = [0] * n
    for _, v in edges:
        in_degree[v] += 1

    result = [i for i in range(n) if in_degree[i] == 0]
    return result
```

This revised solution is much simpler, more efficient (O(n + m) where m is the number of edges), and directly addresses the problem's requirements.

**In Summary:**

The user's initial attempt had the correct starting idea of identifying sources, but the logic to complete the solution was flawed. The score reflects the partially correct approach and some understanding of graph traversal, but the presence of significant errors and inefficiencies."

The Python code provides a correct and well-structured solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the closest divisors for `num + 1` and `num + 2` and returns the pair with the smallest absolute difference.

Here's a breakdown of the code's strengths and areas for slight improvement:

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the correct output for the provided test cases and likely works for other valid inputs as well. The logic for iterating downwards from the square root of the target number is a good optimization.
*   **Functionality:** The code accurately implements the problem description, searching for divisors and comparing their differences.
*   **Efficiency:** The code is reasonably efficient.  The iteration up to the square root provides a good balance between speed and simplicity.
*   **Readability:** The code is readable, with meaningful variable names and a clear structure. The comments are helpful.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** It correctly handles perfect square cases and implicitly handles `num = 1` without error.
*   **Minor Improvements:**

    *   The `if 0 < min_diff:` check inside the perfect square check is unnecessary, since the code already set `min_diff` to `float('inf')` initially. It could be removed for slightly cleaner code.
    *   While not strictly required by the problem, it might be good to explicitly handle `num = 0` with a separate conditional check. Although the present code will still function correctly with `num = 0`, it will produce the somewhat unexpected `[1,1]`.

The SQL query is almost perfect and effectively solves the problem. It correctly uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the `Employees` and `EmployeeUNI` tables, ensuring that all employees are included in the output, even those without a corresponding `unique_id`. The use of `COALESCE` is appropriate for handling the `NULL` values for employees without a `unique_id`.

The only minor issue is the requirement to display 'null' as a string instead of NULL. While many SQL systems will handle the string 'null' comparably, semantically it is incorrect and might cause errors depending on implementation. Returning NULL is better. Also, the prompt does not explicitly ask for the string 'null', but `NULL`.

Here's a slightly improved version:

This is because `COALESCE(euni.unique_id, NULL)` will return `NULL` if `euni.unique_id` is `NULL`. Explicitly stating it makes it clearer, although it is redundant in this situation. The first code is also perfectly acceptable."

In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in [""Jan"",""Feb"",""Mar"",""Apr"",""May"",""Jun"",""Jul"",""Aug"",""Sep"",""Oct"",""Nov"",""Dec""].

    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
  FROM MonthlyRevenue
  GROUP BY id
)
SELECT * FROM PivotedData;

```

This SQL query first uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `MonthlyRevenue` to add a row number for each (id, month) combination. This is not strictly necessary for this particular example because there are no duplicate (id, month) entries in the sample data. However, it's good practice to include it to handle potential duplicates in real-world scenarios where multiple revenue entries might exist for a given (id, month).

The second CTE, `PivotedData`, then uses conditional aggregation with `MAX(CASE WHEN ... END)` to pivot the data.  The `MAX` function is used because we only want one revenue value per month per department.  If there were multiple entries for a given month, `MAX` ensures we pick one (although a `SUM` might be more appropriate depending on the business need).  The `GROUP BY id` clause groups the results by department ID.

Finally, the outer `SELECT` statement retrieves all columns from the `PivotedData` CTE, presenting the results in the desired format.  This approach efficiently handles the pivot operation in SQL without resorting to more complex techniques.",,"100/100
The SQL query is correct, efficient, and well-structured. It correctly pivots the table to display revenue for each month by department ID. The use of CTEs improves readability, and the conditional aggregation with `MAX(CASE WHEN ... END)` is the standard way to achieve this pivoting in SQL. The inclusion of `ROW_NUMBER()` while not strictly needed based on the prompt, is a robust approach."

Explanation: 
User 6 logged into their account 3 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 8 logged into their account 2 times in 2020, once in February and once in December. We include only the latest one (December) in the result table.
User 2 logged into their account 2 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 14 did not login in 2020, so we do not include them in the result table.

","```sql

The SQL query is correct, efficient, readable, and addresses the prompt's requirements perfectly. It filters the logins to only include those from 2020, groups by user ID to find the latest login for each user, and then returns the user ID along with the latest time stamp (aliased as `last_stamp`). It implicitly handles the edge case where a user did not log in during 2020 by simply not including them in the result set, due to the `WHERE` clause. The query is well-structured and uses standard SQL practices."

The provided SQL code is correct, efficient, and well-structured. It effectively solves the problem of finding the number of distinct products sold on each date and listing those products in lexicographical order.

*   **Correctness:** The code produces the exact expected output as defined in the problem description.
*   **Functionality:** It accurately counts distinct products and concatenates their names in the specified format.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of `GROUP_CONCAT` is appropriate for this task and generally efficient for the given problem size. The `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` ensures that each product is only counted once per date.
*   **Readability:** The code is clear and easy to understand, using meaningful aliases (e.g., `DailySales`).
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code correctly handles cases where there are duplicate product entries for the same date. It implicitly handles empty input (an empty Activities table) by returning an empty result set, which is standard SQL behavior.
*   **Best Practices:** The use of a common table expression (CTE) with `WITH` improves readability and organization.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic is sound and directly implements the problem's requirements. The `ORDER BY product` within `GROUP_CONCAT` ensures lexicographical ordering. The final `ORDER BY sell_date` ensures the correct ordering of the result set."

Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

- **Efficiency:** Using a LEFT JOIN is an efficient way to find visits without corresponding transactions. The query avoids unnecessary subqueries or complex operations.
- **Readability & Best Practices:** The query is well-structured and uses meaningful aliases (v and t) for the tables. The use of COUNT(*) and GROUP BY is standard and easy to understand.

Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

","```sql
SELECT

    COALESCE(a.state, 'Null') AS state
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a ON p.personId = a.personId;
```",,"90/100
The SQL query is mostly correct and addresses the problem effectively. The use of `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all persons are included in the output, even those without corresponding entries in the `Address` table.  The `COALESCE` function is used to replace NULL values with the string 'Null', which is what the question requests. However, the question specifically asks to return `Null` (SQL NULL), not the string `""Null""`.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The query produces the correct results for most cases, including the example provided. The structure of the query is sound.
*   **Functionality:**  It correctly joins the tables and retrieves the required fields.
*   **Efficiency:** The query is efficient for the given task, using a `LEFT JOIN` which is appropriate for this scenario.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The query is well-structured and easy to read, using aliases to improve clarity.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The `LEFT JOIN` handles the edge case where a person has no address. The use of `COALESCE` handles `NULL` replacement.
*   **Slight Error:** The problem statement asks to return `NULL` values when the address is not found, but the query returns the *string* `""Null""` due to the `COALESCE` usage.  This is a subtle, but important distinction in SQL.

To fix this, `COALESCE(a.city, NULL)` and `COALESCE(a.state, NULL)` should be used (though `COALESCE` is actually unnecessary, since `LEFT JOIN` will already return `NULL` if there is no match).

Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

Because of this minor deviation from returning actual SQL `NULL` values, the score is slightly reduced."

The SQL query is mostly correct and addresses the problem of finding employee IDs with missing information. It correctly uses `UNION` to combine all employee IDs and then `EXCEPT` to remove those present in both tables. However, it doesn't explicitly check for NULL names or salaries.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The query identifies employee IDs present in one table but not the other. This is the core idea for solving the problem. However, it doesn't handle the case where an employee exists in both tables but has a NULL name or salary.

*   **Functionality:**  Partially functional. Catches missing employee entries in either table.

*   **Efficiency:** The use of `UNION` and `EXCEPT` is generally efficient for this type of problem, especially with proper indexing.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The query is reasonably readable.  Using aliases for the tables would slightly improve readability (although not strictly necessary here).

*   **Edge Case Handling:**  Does *not* handle the cases where an employee exists in both the `Employees` and `Salaries` table but the `name` or `salary` is NULL. This is a major missing edge case.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The underlying logic of combining IDs and then removing those present in both tables is sound.  However, the missing NULL check detracts from the soundness of the solution.

To improve the query, it should be modified to specifically check for NULL names and salaries. Here's a revised version:

```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE name IS NULL
UNION
SELECT employee_id
FROM Salaries
WHERE salary IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

This revised query directly selects `employee_id` from `Employees` where `name` is `NULL` and `employee_id` from `Salaries` where `salary` is `NULL`. Then `UNION` combines the results and `ORDER BY` sorts the result in ascending order."

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

This solution uses a list to store request times.  The `ping` method iterates through the list to count requests within the specified time window. While functional, for a very large number of requests, this approach would become inefficient due to the linear time complexity of the search.  For improved performance with a large number of requests, a data structure like a deque could be used to efficiently manage and search the requests within the time window.","package com.fishercoder.solutions.firstthousand;

The code is functional and produces the correct output for the given example. It correctly implements the RecentCounter class with the ping method. However, the solution's efficiency could be improved.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code is correct and produces the expected output.
*   **Functionality:** It fulfills all requirements of the problem.
*   **Efficiency:** The `ping` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of requests. This is because it iterates through the entire `self.requests` list every time `ping` is called. For a large number of requests (up to 10<sup>4</sup> as specified in the constraints), this could become inefficient. A more efficient approach would involve using a data structure that allows for faster removal of old requests, such as a queue (deque).
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable and uses a meaningful variable name (`requests`).
*   **Edge Case Handling:** It appears to handle the basic cases correctly. Since the problem statement specifies that `t` is strictly increasing, there's no need to handle out-of-order requests. However, no explicit error handling or validation is present, but none is strictly required by the problem statement.
*   **Comparison with Java Solution:** The Java solution provided is for a different problem (Two Sum). There isn't a direct comparison applicable.

To improve the efficiency, a deque could be used. As new requests come in, they are added to the deque. Before counting, elements outside the `[t - 3000, t]` range are removed from the *front* of the deque. This maintains the invariant that the deque always contains only the recent requests. This would reduce the time complexity of each ping operation significantly in cases with many requests."

The code attempts to solve the FizzBuzz problem using threading, which is the core of the question. It correctly identifies the four conditions (fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, and number) and assigns each to a separate thread. It also uses a lock to try and synchronize access to the shared variable `self.i`.

However, there are significant issues preventing it from functioning correctly:

1. **Race Condition:** The fundamental problem is that each thread independently checks `self.i <= self.n` and acquires the lock.  Multiple threads can enter their `while` loops concurrently, and the `self.i += 1` operations, while protected by the lock *individually*, don't guarantee that only one thread prints for a given value of `self.i`. This will result in multiple outputs for some numbers, and some numbers might be skipped altogether.

2. **Incorrect Synchronization:** The locking mechanism only prevents concurrent *printing*, but doesn't enforce the correct order or ensure that only *one* thread processes each number. The lock is released immediately after the print and increment, so other threads immediately contend for the lock again, leading to the race condition described above.

3. **Output Format:** While not a major issue, the prompt asks for a specific output format ""[1,2,""fizz"",4,""buzz"",...]"", and the user's code prints values with trailing commas, but without enclosing square brackets. This is a minor detail that could be fixed.

To fix this, a more robust synchronization mechanism is needed, such as a `Condition` object or a `Semaphore`, to signal which thread should proceed next. The threads must wait until they are signaled before proceeding.  Furthermore, the while condition and lock acquisition should only be done once outside all the `if` statements to check what to print.

Here's an improved (but still not perfect) explanation of what would be needed to get full credit, and why the original is flawed:

The intended solution requires the use of synchronization primitives to ensure that the threads print the correct output in the correct order. The provided solution uses a lock, but it is insufficient to prevent race conditions.

The main issue is that each thread independently checks the condition `self.i <= self.n` and acquires the lock. This allows multiple threads to enter their `while` loops, leading to multiple threads potentially printing for the same value of `i`.

A more correct approach would involve using a `Condition` object to signal each thread when it is its turn to print. Each thread would wait on the condition until it is signaled, and then it would print its corresponding value. The main thread would then increment `self.i` and signal the appropriate thread based on the new value of `self.i`.

The code also lacks proper output format (brackets)."

```",,"100/100
The code is correct, well-structured, and easy to understand. It efficiently solves the problem by using three separate lists to store elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. The code maintains the relative order of elements as required and handles various test cases correctly. The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates through the input list once, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the creation of three new lists. The solution is well-documented with a clear function docstring. The test cases provided cover different scenarios, demonstrating the code's robustness."

**Explanation:**

The problem simplifies to finding the maximum digit in the input string `n`.  This is because to represent the largest digit in the number, you need at least that many deci-binary numbers (each with a '1' in the place value of that digit).  All other digits can be accommodated using some combination of these numbers. For example, if the maximum digit is 8, you will need at least 8 deci-binary numbers to reach that digit. The remaining digits can be made by simply adding more 1s to the existing numbers or creating additional ones.  Therefore, the maximum digit directly corresponds to the minimum number of deci-binary numbers required.  The code efficiently finds this maximum digit and returns it.",,"100/100
The code is perfectly correct and efficient. It leverages the crucial insight that the answer is simply the maximum digit in the input string. The code is also well-structured and readable, with a clear function definition and helpful comments. The test cases included further demonstrate the understanding of the problem."

The code is correct, efficient, and well-structured. It effectively sorts the input array based on the provided function's output. The code handles edge cases such as empty arrays and invalid function inputs gracefully, raising a TypeError when the provided function is not callable. The use of tuples to associate the function output with the original element is a standard and efficient approach for this type of sorting problem. The example usages demonstrate the function's versatility with different data types and functions, further confirming its correctness.

    }
  }
  //Should not happen based on problem definition but adding for robustness
  return false; 
};
```

**Explanation:**

The solution leverages the fact that  `Object.keys(obj).length` gives the number of keys in an object in O(n) time, where n is the number of keys. However, the problem constraints (2 <= JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 105) imply that the size of the object or array will be relatively small, thus treating `Object.keys` as O(1) is a reasonable simplification within the context of the problem.  For arrays, checking `obj.length` is inherently O(1).  The code first checks if the input is an object and then differentiates between arrays and plain objects to apply the appropriate emptiness check.  The added `obj !== null` check handles the case where a null object is passed.  The final `return false` is for completeness, although it shouldn't be reached given the problem statement.",,"95/100
The solution is correct, well-structured, and handles the different cases of arrays and objects effectively. The time complexity consideration is accurate given the problem constraints.  The check for null is a good defensive programming practice.

The only minor improvements would be:

1.  A small comment could be added to explain why `Object.keys(obj).length` can be treated as O(1) in this specific scenario due to the constraint on the length of JSON.stringify(obj).  While the current comment exists, adding more detail on the complexity would be ideal.
2.  It would be ideal to throw an error when the type of input `obj` isn't an object, given the constraint that obj is a valid JSON object or array. However, returning false covers the case well enough."
922,"Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.
You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.
If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.
When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.
An example of how your code would be used:
function* tasks() {
  const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2));
  yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done.
}
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks());
setTimeout(cancel, 50);
promise.catch(console.log); // logs ""Cancelled"" at t=50ms

If instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  return 42; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""resolved"": 42}
Explanation:
const generator = generatorFunction();
const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator);
setTimeout(cancel, 100);
promise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms

The generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing.

Example 2:
Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(""Hello"")); 
  throw `Error: ${msg}`; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""rejected"": ""Error: Hello""}
Explanation:
A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error.

Example 3:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); 
  return ""Success""; 
}
cancelledAt = 100
Output: {""rejected"": ""Cancelled""}

While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.

Example 4:
Input:
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  return result;
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 2}
Explanation:
4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.

Example 5:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  let result = 0; 
  try { 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); 
  } catch(e) { 
    return result; 
  } 
  return result; 
}
cancelledAt = 150
Output: {""resolved"": 1}
Explanation:
The first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise.

Example 6:
Input: 
generatorFunction = function*() { 
  try { 
    yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(""Promise Rejected"")); 
  } catch(e) { 
    let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2));
    let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); 
    return a + b; 
  }; 
}
cancelledAt = null
Output: {""resolved"": 4}
Explanation:
The first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4.

The solution is mostly correct and handles many of the core requirements of the problem.  The `cancellable` function correctly manages the generator, resolves yielded promises, and handles rejections.  The cancel function is implemented and triggers the correct behavior when called before the generator completes.  The test cases are a good indicator of the thoroughness of the approach.

Here's a breakdown of the areas for improvement:

*   **Cancellation Error:** When the generator is cancelled, the problem statement dictates that a string `""Cancelled""` should be thrown *back into the generator*.  The current code correctly rejects the overall promise with `""Cancelled""` but doesn't attempt to inject this error into the generator using `generator.throw()`.  This is a critical missing piece for full correctness.  This impacts examples 3 and 5 significantly.  The provided code just rejects the promise in `cancelled` is true. But the goal is to inject an error into the generator.

*   **`cancelledAt` Variable:** The `cancelledAt` variable is declared but never used. While not strictly incorrect, it suggests an incomplete thought process or misunderstanding of the problem statement.  The prompt includes `cancelledAt` in the problem description (as input) but not the function signature.

*   **Handling Non-Promise Yields:**  The code includes a check for non-Promise yields and rejects the promise. While this addresses a potential error, it's not aligned with the problem's specification, which assumes that the generator only yields promises.  This check is unnecessary based on the problem statement.

*   **Edge Case: Finished Generator Cancellation:**  The problem states that cancelling a finished generator should do nothing. While the code doesn't explicitly *fail* this, it's not explicitly tested, and the implementation could be slightly more robust in handling this situation.

*   **Clarity and Readability:** The `runGenerator` function could benefit from more descriptive variable names.  `generatorResult` is a little vague; perhaps `yieldedValue` would be clearer.

Here's how the score is derived:

*   **Correctness (50/60):** The core promise handling, generator execution, and rejection propagation are mostly correct. The major deduction is for the incorrect cancellation error handling (not throwing into the generator).
*   **Functionality (15/20):** The code implements the core functionality, but the cancellation interaction with the generator is incomplete.
*   **Efficiency (10/10):** No specific efficiency concerns.
*   **Readability & Best Practices (5/5):** Generally readable, could benefit from slightly better variable names.
*   **Edge Case Handling (5/5):** Could explicitly handle cancelling a completed generator, though not explicitly failing in the provided code.
*   **Logical Soundness (Partial Credit):** The overall approach is correct, but a key detail (throwing the ""Cancelled"" error back into the generator) is missing."
923,"Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.
A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.
For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Implement the Skiplist class:

Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.
 
Example 1:
Input
[""Skiplist"", ""add"", ""add"", ""add"", ""search"", ""add"", ""search"", ""erase"", ""erase"", ""search""]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]

The code provides a reasonably good implementation of a Skiplist.

*   **Correctness**: The code appears to be functionally correct based on the provided example and general understanding of Skiplist operations. It handles `search`, `add`, and `erase` operations. The provided test case at the end correctly produces the expected output.

*   **Functionality**: The code fulfills all the specified functional requirements of the Skiplist data structure.

*   **Efficiency**: The code has an average time complexity of O(log n) for search, add, and erase operations, which is the expected performance for a Skiplist. The space complexity is O(n), which is also standard.

*   **Readability & Best Practices**: The code is well-structured with meaningful variable names.  The use of `SkiplistNode` makes the code more readable.

*   **Edge Case Handling**: The code seems to handle the edge cases such as an empty Skiplist, and removing elements from the Skiplist correctly. The `erase` function also correctly adjusts `max_level` when the highest level becomes empty. It also implicitly handles duplicates by simply inserting them and removing one instance during erase.

*   **Potential Improvements**:
    *   The code uses a fixed `max_level` of 32. It is better to dynamically adjust the maximum level based on the number of elements in the Skiplist to optimize space usage. While the problem constraints limit the calls to operations to 5 * 10^4 and the values of `num` and `target` to 2 * 10^4, a more general implementation would avoid the fixed level.
    *   The `update` array is pre-allocated with a fixed size. Although the problem statement limits the inputs, using a dynamic list for `update` could improve memory usage in scenarios with a smaller `max_level`.
    *   The probability of the random level generation is fixed to 0.5, which works well in practice but can be made configurable.

The score is reduced primarily due to the fixed `max_level` which impacts scalability and makes the implementation less general. Otherwise the solution is well structured and addresses the prompt's requirements effectively."

**Runtime Complexity Analysis:**

The original ""Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"" problem (without duplicates) could be solved in O(log n) time using binary search.  The presence of duplicates affects the runtime complexity because in the case where `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, we cannot definitively say whether the minimum element lies in the left or right half.  We have to reduce the search space by decrementing `right` in this situation. In the worst-case scenario (e.g., an array of all the same number except for one smaller number at the end), this could lead to a linear scan (O(n)) because we might have to discard elements one by one.

Therefore, the runtime complexity of this modified algorithm is **O(n) in the worst case and O(log n) in the best and average case.**  The best-case scenario occurs when the minimum element is found quickly, and the average case shows a logarithmic behavior assuming a somewhat random distribution of duplicates.  However, the worst case is linearly dependent on the size of the input.","package com.fishercoder.solutions.firstthousand;

The code is well-structured, readable, and logically sound. It correctly implements a binary search approach to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array, even when duplicates are present. The example usages are helpful for demonstrating the function's behavior.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

*   **Correctness (25/25):** The code passes all provided test cases, including edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays with many duplicates. The logic for handling duplicates (`right -= 1`) is correctly implemented. The runtime complexity analysis in the code description is also accurate.
*   **Functionality (25/25):** The code effectively addresses the problem of finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array with duplicates.
*   **Efficiency (20/25):** While the code uses binary search, the presence of duplicates degrades the worst-case time complexity to O(n). This is unavoidable given the problem constraints. The code could include a comment about the time complexity to provide clarity for the user.
*   **Readability & Best Practices (15/15):** The code is easy to understand, with meaningful variable names and a clear function definition. The docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
*   **Edge Case Handling (10/10):** The code gracefully handles edge cases such as empty input lists and arrays with duplicate values.
*   **Comparison to Java Solution** The provided Java solution solves a different problem (Two Sum). Therefore, it is not comparable.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

1.  Add a comment in the code about the worst-case O(n) time complexity due to duplicates.
2.  Add input validation to check if the array is empty or null. While the question specifies that the array will have a length between 1 and 5000, adding this check can improve the robustness of your code and avoid potential errors."
927,"Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.
A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.
fn can be any function and there are no constraints on what type of values it accepts. Inputs are considered identical if they are === to each other.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
getInputs = () => [[2,2],[2,2],[1,2]]
fn = function (a, b) { return a + b; }
Output: [{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":4,""calls"":1},{""val"":3,""calls"":2}]
Explanation:
const inputs = getInputs();
const memoized = memoize(fn);
for (const arr of inputs) {
  memoized(...arr);
}

For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, and it required a call to fn().
For the inputs of (2, 2): 2 + 2 = 4, but those inputs were seen before so no call to fn() was required.
For the inputs of (1, 2): 1 + 2 = 3, and it required another call to fn() for a total of 2.

Example 2:
Input: 
getInputs = () => [[{},{}],[{},{}],[{},{}]] 
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":2},{""val"":{},""calls"":3}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. It may seem like there should only be 1 call to fn() because of cache-hits, however none of those objects are === to each other.

Example 3:
Input: 
getInputs = () => { const o = {}; return [[o,o],[o,o],[o,o]]; }
fn = function (a, b) { return ({...a, ...b}); }
Output: [{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1},{""val"":{},""calls"":1}]
Explanation:
Merging two empty objects will always result in an empty object. The 2nd and 3rd third function calls result in a cache-hit. This is because every object passed in is identical.

```

This improved solution addresses several key aspects:

1. **Reliable Key Generation:**  It uses `JSON.stringify(args)` to create keys for the cache. This handles various input types (numbers, objects, arrays) more robustly than simply using `args.toString()`.  `JSON.stringify` provides a consistent string representation for comparison.

2. **Clearer Structure:** The code is organized into a `memoize` function and a `testMemoize` helper function for clearer separation of concerns.

3. **Adaptability:** `testMemoize` function takes `getInputs` and `fn` as parameters, making it easily reusable for different test cases.

4. **Correctness:** It accurately reflects the memoization behavior, properly counting calls and returning cached values.  The use of `Map` provides efficient key-value storage for the cache.

5. **Error Handling (Implicit):** `JSON.stringify` will handle most common data types.  While it might not handle *all* possible data types perfectly (like circular objects), it's a practical approach for a general-purpose memoization function.  If you need to handle more exotic data structures, a more sophisticated key generation strategy might be required.

The output of this code will match the expected outputs for all three examples.  The `console.log` statements provide the results in the format specified in the problem description.",,"90/100
The solution provides a good implementation of memoization in JavaScript. The use of `JSON.stringify` for generating cache keys is a reasonable approach for handling various input types. The structure of the code, with the `memoize` function and the `testMemoize` helper, improves readability and testability. The solution correctly handles the provided examples and addresses the core requirements of the problem.

Here are some minor points for improvement:

*   **Cache Access in Test Function:**  The `testMemoize` function accesses the internal `cache` property of the memoized function ( `memoizedFn.cache`). While this works, it's generally better to avoid accessing internal implementation details in test code. A more robust approach would be to track the number of calls within the `testMemoize` function itself, without relying on the `cache` directly.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** While `JSON.stringify` handles many cases, it might not be suitable for all possible input types (e.g., circular references, custom objects with no meaningful string representation). A more robust solution might involve a custom key generation function that handles these specific edge cases. However, for the problem's constraints, the current approach is generally sufficient.

*   **Efficiency:** The `find` method inside of testMemoize is inefficient. It iterates through the entire cache on every call.

Overall, the solution is well-structured, correct, and addresses the main aspects of the problem. The suggested improvements are minor and focus on robustness and best practices rather than fundamental correctness."
928,"Design the CombinationIterator class:

CombinationIterator(string characters, int combinationLength) Initializes the object with a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.
next() Returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.
hasNext() Returns true if and only if there exists a next combination.

 
Example 1:
Input
[""CombinationIterator"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext""]
[[""abc"", 2], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, ""ab"", true, ""ac"", true, ""bc"", false]

CombinationIterator itr = new CombinationIterator(""abc"", 2);
itr.next();    // return ""ab""
itr.hasNext(); // return True
itr.next();    // return ""ac""
itr.hasNext(); // return True
itr.next();    // return ""bc""
itr.hasNext(); // return False

 
Constraints:

1 <= combinationLength <= characters.length <= 15
All the characters of characters are unique.
At most 104 calls will be made to next and hasNext.
It is guaranteed that all calls of the function next are valid.

This solution leverages the `itertools.combinations` function for efficient generation of combinations.  It stores all combinations upfront. This is acceptable given the constraint that `characters.length` is at most 15.  For significantly larger input strings, a more memory-efficient iterative approach might be necessary, but this approach is clear, concise, and meets the constraints of the problem.

The solution sorts the piles in descending order.  Then, it iterates through the sorted list, skipping the first (Alice's) and last (Bob's) elements of each group of three, accumulating only the second-largest pile of coins in each group (which is guaranteed to be yours by the problem definition).  This ensures you always pick the optimal second-largest pile in each round. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), where n is the number of piles.

The code attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming with memoization. The core idea of exploring possible moves and determining the best outcome for each player recursively is sound. However, there are several issues that prevent the code from being fully correct and efficient.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Memoization Key:** The memoization key `(index, current_sum_alice, current_sum_bob)` is problematic.  The sums `current_sum_alice` and `current_sum_bob` are not necessary to determine the optimal outcome from a given index.  This significantly increases the memory usage and reduces the effectiveness of memoization, potentially leading to stack overflow errors or exceeding time limits for larger inputs.  The optimal strategy from a certain index onward depends only on the remaining stones (represented by `index`).

2. **Incorrect Turn Logic:** The logic for determining whose turn it is (`if index % 2 == 0`) is also incorrect. It assumes that the index directly corresponds to the turn, which isn't true as multiple stones (1, 2, or 3) can be taken in a single turn.  This leads to incorrect evaluations of moves.

3. **Incorrect `min` calculation:** The `min(4, n - index + 1)` calculation is off.  It should be `min(4, n - index)`.

4. **Inefficiency:** Even with corrected memoization, the recursion with memoization approach might be less efficient than a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, especially for the given constraints.

5. **Clarity:** The code can be improved in terms of readability by adding comments to explain each section, especially the recursive calls and the memoization process.  The logic behind initializing `best_outcome` could also be clarified.

Here's how the code could be improved (conceptual):

1. **Correct Memoization:** The memoization key should only be `index`.  `dp[index]` should store the difference between Alice's and Bob's scores if they both play optimally starting from that index.
2. **Turn-Independent Logic:** The `solve` function should calculate the optimal score difference achievable by the *current* player from the given `index` *onward*. The `index % 2` logic should be removed. The function returns the best score difference, regardless of which player is currently making a move.
3. **Optimal Move Calculation:** Inside the `solve` function, iterate through the possible number of stones to take (1, 2, or 3). For each number of stones, recursively calculate the *negative* of the optimal score difference achievable by the *other* player from the remaining stones.  The current player wants to *maximize* their score difference, so take the `max` of all these negated score differences.
4. **Base Case:** When `index == n`, return 0 (no stones left, score difference is 0).

With these improvements, the solution will be correct and more efficient. Given the existing code's attempt at dynamic programming but flawed logic, a score of 50/100 seems appropriate."
939,"Given a multi-dimensional array arr and a depth n, return a flattened version of that array.
A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.
A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.
Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.

arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 0
Output
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]

Explanation
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. 
Example 2:
Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 1
Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15]

Explanation
The subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its depth is 1.
Example 3:
Input
arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 2

The code is correct, well-structured, and addresses all the requirements of the problem. It uses recursion effectively to flatten the multi-dimensional array up to the specified depth `n`. The code is readable, with a clear function definition and meaningful variable names. The base case for the recursion is handled correctly, and the depth is tracked accurately. The example usage demonstrates the expected behavior for the given test cases. Furthermore, it correctly avoids using the built-in `Array.flat` method, as required by the prompt. The solution also includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value, which enhances readability and maintainability.

940,"Given an object or array obj, return a compact object. A compact object is the same as the original object, except with keys containing falsy values removed. This operation applies to the object and any nested objects. Arrays are considered objects where the indices are keys. A value is considered falsy when Boolean(value) returns false.
You may assume the obj is the output of JSON.parse. In other words, it is valid JSON.
 
Example 1:

This solution recursively traverses the object (or array) and removes falsy values.  It handles arrays and nested objects correctly. The base case for recursion is when a primitive type (not an object or array) is encountered, in which case it's returned unchanged.  The use of `Boolean(value)` ensures accurate falsy value checking.  The `hasOwnProperty` check prevents issues with inherited properties.",,"90/100
The code is mostly correct and addresses the problem's requirements effectively. It handles nested objects and arrays and removes falsy values as expected. The code is also relatively readable and well-structured.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation and potential improvements:

*   **Correctness:** The code passes all provided test cases and appears to handle various scenarios involving nested objects and arrays with falsy values.
*   **Functionality:** The code fulfills the problem statement by recursively compacting the object and removing falsy values.
*   **Efficiency:** The code has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in the object/array, due to its recursive traversal. This is generally acceptable for the given constraints. The space complexity depends on the depth of the nesting, and in the worst case (deeply nested structure) could also be O(N).
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is reasonably readable.  Variable names are meaningful. The use of `hasOwnProperty` is a good practice.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** It correctly handles `null` values.

*   **Potential Improvements:**

    *   **Array Filtering and Mapping:**  The array filtering and mapping in the `isArray` case could be slightly optimized.  The filtering removes falsy values, *then* maps.  However, falsy values are already removed *before* the map function is applied to each item by checking  `Boolean(item)`. It calls `compactObject` on falsy values which is unnecessary. It doesn't cause incorrect behaviour, but it's inefficient.
    *   **Return Empty Objects:** Returning empty objects/arrays are allowed based on the problem descriptions, but can potentially be considered for removal. The prompt does not explicitly state how to handle this edge case so the current logic does not cause an issue.

Here is the optimized solution:

```javascript
function compactObject(obj) {
  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(item => compactObject(item)).filter(item => Boolean(item));
  } else if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null) {
    const compactedObj = {};
    for (const key in obj) {
      if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        const value = compactObject(obj[key]);
        if (Boolean(value)) {
          compactedObj[key] = value;
        }
      }
    }
    return compactedObj;
  } else {
    return obj; // Handle primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans)
  }
}
```
The key difference is that filtering happens after mapping."

**Explanation:**

The solution iterates through the input string `s`. It keeps track of the number of opened parentheses using the `opened` variable.  

- If it encounters an opening parenthesis '(', it increments `opened`. If `opened` is greater than 1 (meaning it's not the outermost parenthesis of a primitive string), it appends the '(' to the `result`.

- If it encounters a closing parenthesis ')', it decrements `opened`. If `opened` is greater than 0 (meaning it's not the outermost parenthesis of a primitive string), it appends the ')' to the `result`.

This way, only the inner parentheses of each primitive string are added to the `result`, effectively removing the outermost parentheses.  The final `result` string is returned.","package com.fishercoder.solutions.firstthousand;

The code is correct, efficient, and readable. It iterates through the string once, which is optimal. The logic is clear and easy to follow. It covers all test cases provided in the prompt.

However, this makes the code a bit more robust.

The only minor suggestion would be adding input validation (though not required based on problem description). For instance, the code does not explicitly handle cases where the input command contains invalid characters *other* than 'G', '(', ')', 'a', and 'l', or '(' isn't followed by ')' or 'al)'. The `else` statement provides some protection but will also skip any single character. It would be beneficial to raise an exception or return an error message if the input string contains invalid characters or patterns to clearly indicate invalid input and improve robustness."

The code provides a good starting point for solving the matrix flipping problem. The general idea of using a BFS approach to explore possible states is correct. However, there are several issues that prevent it from working correctly and efficiently:

1. **Incorrect `flip` function modification:** The `flip` function modifies the original matrix `mat` directly. This is problematic because the BFS algorithm relies on exploring different states without permanently altering the previous state.  Deep copies are necessary.

2. **`flip_copy` lambda error:** The attempt to use a lambda function, `flip_copy = lambda r,c: flip(r,c)`, does not address the issue of modifying the original matrix, `mat`. It simply assigns the `flip` function to a new name.

3. **Inefficient Matrix Copying:** The deep copy of the matrix `next_mat = [row[:] for row in curr_mat]`  is performed inside the nested loops. It should occur within the flip simulation, but it also contributes to increased time complexity.

4. **Time Complexity:** The code has high time complexity because it explores all possible combinations of flips. For a 3x3 matrix, there are 2^9 possible combinations, which can lead to a timeout for larger inputs.

5. **Missing copy in queue:** The `next_mat` being added to the queue is not a deep copy of the modified matrix. The state tuple must be derived from a deep copy of the matrix, ensuring subsequent states are derived from unique matrices.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is not fully correct and suggestions for improvement:

- The core logic of using BFS to explore different states is sound.
- The `flip` function needs to be revised to operate on a *copy* of the input matrix, *not* the original.
- Matrix copying should be done correctly within the state transition.
- Optimizations like pruning the search space (if possible) could improve performance.
- Consider using bit manipulation for states to improve the speed and memory usage when adding to the visited set.

```

Key improvements in the corrected code:

- The `flip` function now receives a matrix as input and returns a *new*, flipped matrix, avoiding direct modifications to the original.
- The `flip` function creates a deep copy of the matrix it receives using `[row[:] for row in matrix]`. This is crucial for correct BFS exploration.
- The `next_state` is now correctly calculated based on the modified copy.
- Changed is_zero check to use pythonic 'all' for efficiency
- Visited is constructed using a comprehension for efficiency."

The SQL query is well-structured, readable, and logically sound. It correctly addresses the problem requirements, including edge cases where there might be months and countries without any approved transactions. The use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) makes the query easier to understand. The `strftime` function is used correctly to extract the year and month from the `trans_date`. The `COALESCE` function handles cases where there are no approved transactions for a given month and country, ensuring that the `approved_count` and `approved_total_amount` are displayed as 0 in those cases. The query uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all months and countries are included in the final result, even if there are no approved transactions. The grouping and aggregation are performed correctly."

The solution is almost perfect and addresses the problem effectively using SQL.

*   **Correctness:** The query produces the expected output and correctly categorizes salaries. It handles the case where a category has no accounts by using `COALESCE` to return 0.
*   **Functionality:** The query solves the problem as described. It uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) to categorize salaries and then joins this with a table containing all possible categories.
*   **Efficiency:** The query is reasonably efficient. The use of a CTE and `GROUP BY` is a standard approach for this type of problem. There isn't much room for significant optimization here.
*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured and easy to read. The use of aliases (`AS category`, `AS accounts_count`) improves readability. The CTE is named descriptively.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the edge case where a salary category has no accounts by using `COALESCE`. This ensures that all three categories are always present in the output with a count of 0 if necessary.
*   **Logical Soundness:** The logic is clear and correct. The use of `CASE` statement to categorize salaries is appropriate. The `UNION ALL` is used to create a table with all the possible categories which is then outer joined to the actual data.

The only minor improvement could be to include the `COALESCE` within the CTE itself, though it doesn't change the final outcome.
```sql
WITH SalaryCategories AS (
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
            WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'
            ELSE 'High Salary'
        END AS category,
        COALESCE(COUNT(*),0) AS accounts_count --Include coalesce here.
    FROM Accounts
    GROUP BY category
)
SELECT
    category,
    COALESCE(accounts_count, 0) AS accounts_count --This coalesce is now redundant but doesn't hurt anything.
FROM (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Average Salary' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'High Salary'

The code provides a reasonable approach to solving the problem. It correctly handles inserting new intervals and merging overlapping intervals. However, there are areas where it can be improved in terms of efficiency and correctness.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The core logic for merging and inserting intervals is mostly correct. The code addresses the key aspects of the problem. It handles merging with previous and next intervals, though the logic could be simplified. The final merging step to remove overlaps seems a bit convoluted and redundant, especially with the sort at the end. It works but isn't the most efficient way. There's an unnecessary re-initialization of `self.intervals` within the loop that will slow it down.

*   **Functionality:** The code appears to correctly implement the `addNum` and `getIntervals` methods as described in the problem. However, some test cases might expose issues in edge case handling or merging logic.

*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity of the `addNum` function is potentially O(n) in the worst case (where n is the number of intervals) due to the `while` loop for finding the insertion point and the linear-time merging process. The unnecessary `sort()` call at the end also adds to the complexity. Using a data structure like a balanced binary search tree (e.g., TreeMap in Java or a similar structure in Python if available) could improve the efficiency of finding the insertion point to O(log n).

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is somewhat readable, but could benefit from more descriptive variable names and clearer comments. The logic for merging could be simplified for better understanding.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code seems to handle some edge cases, such as inserting a new interval at the beginning or end. But more comprehensive testing is required to ensure robustness.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall approach is logically sound, but the implementation details have room for improvement. The use of a sorted list of intervals and the merging strategy is a valid way to solve the problem. The final overlap removal section can be made more efficient.

Improvements:

1.  Simplify the merging logic to avoid redundant iterations.
2.  Consider using a more efficient data structure for storing intervals, such as a balanced binary search tree, to reduce the time complexity of insertion and merging.
3.  Remove unnecessary operations like the intermediate list and resorting.
4.  Improve readability with better variable names and comments.
5. Write comprehensive test cases to catch edge cases and ensure correctness.

Based on the assessment, the code receives a score of 75/100. It demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and implements a reasonable solution, but there is significant room for improvement in terms of efficiency, code clarity, and potentially some edge case handling. The unnecessary `sort()` is the biggest hit to the score."

This improved solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently handle larger inputs. The `solve` function recursively explores possible colorings, ensuring no adjacent cells have the same color.  The bit manipulation is replaced by a more readable integer-based representation of the color mask.  The code is also well-commented and includes example usage.  The time complexity is significantly reduced compared to a purely recursive approach due to memoization.",,"85/100
The code provides a dynamic programming solution with memoization, which is a good approach for this problem. However, there's a critical flaw in how it checks for adjacent cell conflicts, specifically when `m > 1`. It only checks if adjacent cells in a column have the same color and if the cell above the current cell has the same color in the next column. It's missing the check whether the adjacent horizontal cells in the same row have the same colors. This means it is not considering all constraints of the question.
For example when m = 2 and n = 2

Possible grid:
R G
B R

Is a valid configuration. However, this valid configuration would be ruled out using the code because the next_color(R) == prev_color(R)

The code is well-structured and readable, and it correctly handles the modulo operation.  The base cases are handled implicitly by the loop and recursion. The use of `3**m` for masks works well for the constraints. The memoization also helps with efficiency.

Because the core logic for adjacent conflict checks is partially incorrect, the code will produce incorrect results for some cases, especially when 'm' is greater than 1. Therefore, the score is reduced."

The code attempts to solve the problem by simulating the operations on the binary representation of the number. The logic for applying the operations based on the bit patterns seems reasonable at first glance. However, there are some potential issues in the implementation that affect its correctness and efficiency.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Correctness:** The code passes the provided test cases, but it's not guaranteed to be correct for all inputs, especially larger ones. The primary reason is that the logic for applying Operation 2 isn't entirely correct. It identifies the highest set bit and then checks for consecutive 1s to the left. However, it doesn't strictly follow the rule that requires *only* the (i-1)th bit to be set to 1, with bits (i-2) through 0 set to 0. The condition `while j < len(binary_n) and binary_n[len(binary_n)-1-j] == '1':` just checks for consecutive 1s and doesn't account for the 0s to the right of the 1s. This can lead to incorrect application of Operation 2 in some scenarios. Also, repeated converting to binary string is also making it less efficient.

*   **Functionality:** The code aims to solve the problem as described.

*   **Efficiency:** Converting to binary string in each loop iteration makes the code inefficient. It can be improved by working directly with the integer and bitwise operations. The time complexity is O(k*log n), where 'k' is number of iterations and n is the input integer. Repeated binary conversions make it expensive, and binary_n length check also adds time.

*   **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is moderately readable with comments explaining the logic. Variable names are meaningful. However, the repeated binary conversions makes the logic harder to follow.

*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code handles the edge case of `n = 0` correctly.

*   **Logical Soundness:** The overall approach of simulating the bit manipulations is logically sound, but the implementation of Operation 2 is flawed.

To improve the solution, consider these points:

1.  **Correct Operation 2 Implementation:** Review and adjust the logic for Operation 2 to accurately match the problem's constraints. Specifically, ensure that the condition only applies when the (i-1)th bit is 1 and all bits to the right are 0. This requires a more precise check than just consecutive 1s.

2.  **Efficiency:** Avoid repeated binary conversions. Manipulate the number directly using bitwise operations. This will significantly improve the performance. For example, use `n & 1` to check if the last bit is 1, `n >>= 1` to shift the bits to the right, and `n ^ (1 << i)` to flip the ith bit.

3.  **Test Thoroughly:** Create a broader set of test cases, especially with larger numbers and different bit patterns, to ensure the corrected code functions properly.

Here's an example of what the logic should look like for operation 2: if the current bit is 0, check if the previous bit is 1 and all bits before that are 0. The user's code checks for a sequence of ones before the current bit."
953,"A scenic location is represented by its name and attractiveness score, where name is a unique string among all locations and score is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.
You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
	
For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th best location of all locations already added.



Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.
Implement the SORTracker class:

SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.
string get() Queries and returns the ith best location, where i is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

The code attempts to use a heap to maintain the sorted order of locations. The `add` function correctly pushes elements onto the heap, using a negative score for proper sorting and including the name for lexicographical comparison when scores are equal. However, the `get` function is inefficient. It uses `heapq.nsmallest` to find the `query_count` smallest elements every time `get` is called. This results in O(N log k) complexity for each get operation where N is the total number of locations and k is query_count, making the overall solution inefficient.  A better approach would involve maintaining a separate data structure (e.g., a sorted list or using two heaps) to efficiently track the ith smallest element. Furthermore, although the example usage is included, it's not part of the class definition and doesn't provide automated tests. It should be tested with different use cases for robustness."
954,"You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the position of city i. You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including start and finish).

The code provides a correct and well-structured solution to the problem. The recursive approach with memoization (using a dictionary `dp`) is efficient for the given constraints. The code is readable, uses meaningful variable names, and handles the modulo operation correctly.

Here's a breakdown of why the score isn't a perfect 100:

*   **Minor Efficiency Consideration:** While the memoization makes the solution efficient enough to pass within the constraints, a tabular (bottom-up) DP approach could slightly improve performance, especially with respect to potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs (though unlikely to be a problem within these constraints). The dictionary-based memoization handles the constraints perfectly well though.

*   **No Explicit Input Validation:** While the problem statement specifies constraints on the input values, the code itself doesn't explicitly validate these constraints. Adding input validation would make the solution more robust, although not strictly necessary based on the prompt.

Overall, the solution demonstrates a strong understanding of dynamic programming and recursion. The code is well-written and produces the correct results. The choice of memoization via dictionary is good."

The code provides a correct and efficient solution to the minimum deviation problem. It correctly transforms odd numbers, uses a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently track the largest number, and iteratively reduces the largest even number until it becomes odd, updating the minimum deviation along the way.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths and areas for minor improvement:

*   **Correctness:** The code passes all provided test cases and addresses the core logic of the problem effectively.
*   **Functionality:** The algorithm correctly minimizes deviation by repeatedly dividing the largest even number. The initial transformation of odd numbers by multiplying by 2 is also correct.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of a heap (priority queue) allows for efficient retrieval of the maximum element (O(1) access, O(log n) for insertion/deletion). This leads to a time complexity of roughly O(n log n * k) in the worst case, where k is the maximum number of times an element can be divided by 2. Space complexity is O(n) due to the heap.
*   **Readability:** The code is reasonably readable, with a clear function definition and comments explaining the logic.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** The code implicitly handles cases with small input sizes. Transforming all odd numbers `num` to `num * 2` and then processing based on the largest element being even is a clever way to proceed with minimizing the deviation.
*   **Potential Improvements:**

    *   **Loop Termination Condition:** The `while all(x % 2 == 0 for x in [-x for x in pq])` is functional, but may have higher computational overhead each time, for a large queue. It also becomes false when the *largest* element is odd but there may still be other even elements in the priority queue. A more efficient condition might involve tracking whether the current largest value is even and continuing the loop as long as the largest value in the queue is even. A flag or separate check for whether the largest number is even would make it more efficient and readable.
    *   **Clarity of Variable names:** While mostly good, renaming 'pq' to something more descriptive like 'max_heap' would further improve readability.

Because of the inefficient way to check the while loop condition, and the non descriptive variable names, I am deducting 10 points. Overall, it's a well reasoned solution."
959,"There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.
You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.
 
Example 1:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

3 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
The given edges represent a valid star graph.

The Python code provides two methods for finding the center of a star graph. Both methods are logically sound and will produce the correct output. However, the first method (counting degrees) is clearly more efficient for larger graphs, as the problem statement specifies. The second method, while correct, involves set operations which can be slower, especially as the number of edges increases.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Correctness:** Both methods are correct and return the center node as expected.
* **Functionality:** The code solves the problem effectively.
* **Efficiency:** The code contains an efficient method using degree counts, which is appropriate given the problem constraints. The less efficient second method is also included.
* **Readability & Best Practices:** The code is well-structured and includes a docstring explaining the function and its arguments. Variable names are meaningful.  The comments are very helpful in explaining the two approaches.
* **Edge Case Handling:** The problem statement guarantees a valid star graph, so explicit edge case handling isn't strictly necessary. The provided code implicitly handles the valid graph case.
* **Logical Soundness:**  Both approaches (degree counting and intersection) are logically correct.

The main deduction in points is due to the inclusion of a less efficient method. While it's good to show alternative approaches, it's best to highlight the most efficient one as the primary solution, especially considering the problem constraints. If the degree count method was the *only* method provided, the score would be significantly higher."

Your task is to: Give detailed feedback on the solution, highlighting strengths, identifying areas for improvement, and pointing out any missing or incorrect aspects.Assign a score between 0 and 100 based on how well the user's solution aligns with the ideal answer. The score should reflect the correctness, completeness, and clarity of the solution.Here’s how to proceed: Read the Question:{question}.\\n Understand the requirements of the question. Evaluate the following answer: {answer}.\\n Compare the user's solution to the expected answer or standard criteria for that question. Consider whether the solution addresses all key points, uses appropriate methods, and avoids critical mistakes.Provide Feedback: Write constructive comments explaining what the user did well and what could be improved. Assign a Score: The score should reflect the degree of correctness, with 0 meaning the solution is entirely incorrect and 100 meaning it is perfect. For example: Question: Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning and how to address it. User's Answer: Overfitting happens when a model performs very well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. It can be solved using dropout or by adding more layers to the model. Ideal Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise and details of the training data instead of the underlying patterns, causing poor performance on unseen data. It can be mitigated using techniques like cross-validation, regularization (e.g., L1, L2), reducing model complexity, or increasing training data. Feedback: Strengths: The user correctly identified overfitting as an issue with generalization and mentioned dropout as a potential solution. Improvements: Adding more layers may worsen overfitting, not fix it. Other key solutions like regularization, reducing model complexity, and cross-validation were missing. Score: 70/100.Based on the user's input, follow this framework to provide feedback and a score for their answer to the given question.\""

Your task is to answer the open questions provided to you in a professional, clear, and concise manner, as if you are participating in a real interview. Understand the Question: Take a moment to fully grasp what is being asked. The question may be a professional one or a question about you. If the question requires an example or explanation, make sure to provide one. Answer Clearly: Provide structured responses. Use full sentences, avoid unnecessary jargon, and ensure your answer directly addresses the question. Be Thoughtful: Demonstrate your expertise by including relevant concepts, examples, or real-world applications in your answers. Stay Brief: Avoid over-explaining but ensure your answer is complete. Strike a balance between depth and brevity. For example: Question: 'Can you explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning and provide a solution to address it?'. Your Answer: 'Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. To address it, we can use techniques like regularization (e.g., L1 or L2), reduce the complexity of the model, or employ cross-validation to ensure robust performance'.\\nThis is the questions for you: {question}\"\n",

Evaluation Process: Consider the core skills and competencies needed for the job. Analyze whether the question effectively tests these skills or knowledge areas. \\nInput Example: Job: 'Data Analyst'. seniority: 'junior'. Skills: 'SQL, RDBMS, Non-RDBMS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Inferential Statistics, Probability, ETL, Data Pipeline, Automated Reporting, Data Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Git, Hive, Spark, Presto, Diagnostic Analytics, Forecasting, Big Data, problem-solving.' \\nQuestion: 'How would you handle missing values in a dataset?'. \\nAnalysis: Relevance Score: 9 (The question directly relates to data preprocessing, which is crucial for data analysts).

    "#### 🔹 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** **2.2530**  \n",
    "- The average absolute difference between the predicted and true values is **2.25**.\n",
    "- Lower values indicate better predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** **6.2556**  \n",
    "- Measures squared differences, penalizing larger errors more than MAE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** **2.5011**  \n",
    "- Shows that typical prediction errors are around **2.50** units.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** **-0.4725**  \n",
    "- **Negative R²** suggests that the model performs **worse than simply predicting the mean** of `feedback`.  \n",
    "- Ideally, R² should be closer to **1**, meaning the model explains most of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The model has significant prediction errors, and its predictions do not explain much of the variance in the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Correlation Analysis**  \n",
    "#### 🔹 **Pearson Correlation:** **0.1369** (p=0.0001)  \n",
    "- Weak **linear** correlation between predictions and true values.  \n",
    "- **p-value < 0.05** suggests statistical significance but not practical significance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Spearman Rank Correlation:** **0.0939** (p=0.0073)  \n",
    "- Measures **monotonic relationships**; a small positive value suggests a weak association.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Kendall’s Tau:** **0.0750** (p=0.0032)  \n",
    "- Also indicates a very weak correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The predicted `heuristic_score` values are **weakly correlated** with the true `feedback` values, meaning the model is **not capturing meaningful patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Statistical Tests**  \n",
    "#### 🔹 **Paired t-test:** **t=-20.1937, p=0.0000**  \n",
    "- The t-test checks whether predictions and actual values have significantly different means.  \n",
    "- Since **p = 0.0000** (very small), the difference is **statistically significant**, meaning the model is **systematically biased**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:** **W=52274.0000, p=0.0000**  \n",
    "- A non-parametric test that confirms significant differences between actual and predicted values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The predicted values **systematically differ** from the true values, suggesting **model bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Error Distribution Analysis**  \n",
    "#### 🔹 **Histogram of Errors** (True - Predicted)  \n",
    "- Errors are **not normally distributed**.  \n",
    "- There is a clear bias with more negative errors, suggesting **underprediction** (i.e., predictions are lower than actual values).  \n",
    "- Bimodal distribution suggests **systematic prediction errors** for different groups of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Q-Q Plot of Errors**  \n",
    "- The points **deviate from the red diagonal**, especially in the tails, meaning the errors **are not normally distributed**.  \n",
    "- There is an excess of extreme errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Skewness = 0.5419**  \n",
    "- **Positive skew** means more predictions **underestimate** feedback values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 **Kurtosis = -0.8881**  \n",
    "- Negative kurtosis suggests a **flatter distribution**, meaning fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "- **Errors are biased** (predictions are too low).  \n",
    "- **Non-normal error distribution** suggests the need for **model improvement** (e.g., different transformation techniques or feature engineering).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Takeaways & Recommendations**  \n",
    "❌ **Current Issues:**  \n",
    "- **High error values** (MAE = 2.25, RMSE = 2.50).  \n",
    "- **Negative R²** suggests the model is **worse than random guessing**.  \n",
    "- **Weak correlation** (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall all close to 0).  \n",
    "- **Systematic underprediction** (positive skew).  \n",
    "- **Significant difference** between actual and predicted values (paired t-test, Wilcoxon test).  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Next Steps to Improve the Model:**  \n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
    "   - Include additional relevant features that may improve prediction accuracy.  \n",
    "   - Consider **non-linear transformations** of input variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Try a Different Model:**  \n",
    "   - If using a **linear model**, consider a **non-linear regression model** (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks).  \n",
    "   - If using a **simple heuristic**, explore **ML-based models**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Address Scaling Issues:**  \n",
    "   - Try different normalization strategies for **heuristic_score** before rescaling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Systematic Bias:**  \n",
    "   - If predictions are systematically **lower**, adjust model predictions using bias correction.  \n",
    "   - Try quantile regression to model different parts of the feedback distribution."
